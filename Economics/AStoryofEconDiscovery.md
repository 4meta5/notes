## Econ 101

The problem is that the two fundamental theorems of Adam Smith lead off in quite different and ultimately contradictory diretions. The Pin Factory is about falling costs and *increasing* returns. The Invisible Hand is about rising costs and *decreasing* returns. Which is the more important principle?...In 1951, George Stigler had written, "Either the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market, and, characteristically, industries are monopolized; or industries are characteristically competitive, and the [Invisible Hand] theorem is false or of little significance." (46)

Ricardo and Malthus had discovered the **principle of diminishing returns** -- the idea that, after a certain point, each succeeding increment of effort might produce less output. The first barrel of fertilizer does a lot, but the tenth only burns the crops. The same must be true of seed or water or time spent weeding. There must be a point at which nothing more can be obtained from adding an hour to the workday, or another worker in the field, or another row of seeds, or another tool, or an extra dose of plant food. (53)

Already in *The Communish Manifesto* he [Marx] had summed up the situation more succinctly than any comparable economics text of his day: "The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature's forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalization of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground -- what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor?" (64)

Here's the way William Stanley Jevons excitedly put it in 1871: "The nature of Wealth and Value is explained by the consideration of indefinitely small amounts of pleasure and plain, just as the theory of Statics is made to rest upon the inequality of indefinitely small amounts of energy." (69)

But it was Jevons who won the day with arguments such as this: "**The ratio of exchange between any two commodities will be the reciprocal of the ratio of the final [marginal] degrees of utility of the quantities of commodity available for consumption after the exchange is completed**." (70)

The frank recognition that the market couldn't necessarily always be depended upon to get things right was highly subversive of the received wisdom. It raised the possibility of "multiple equilibria." Instead of the single, general, dependable, best-possible equilibrium of supply and demand that the Invisible Hand was supposed to produce, a high-unemployment equilibrium was possible as well. The economy could become "stuck," far from its full-employment equilibrium. A new mechanism was identified to account for this possibility -- wage rigidity, or "sticky" wages that employes and employees were unwilling to adjust. Psychological factors became newly important -- labeled "liquidity preference" and the "propensity to consume," to be restated as the "consumption function." (100)

starting from a maxim known as Le Chatelier's principle, which at one level could be stated simply as "Squeeze a balloon and its volume will contract," it was possible to work out mathematical formulation that would apply just as well to a profit-maximizing firm trying to decide what inputs to buy as to the balloon. "**Pressure adnd volume, or for that matter absolute temperature and entropy, have to each other the same conjugate or dualistic relation that the wage rate does to labor, or the land rent does to acres of land.**"(116)

## What is Economics and what does studying it entail?

Managing the tension between these ends -- furthering the growth of knowledge while ensuring that its benefits are widely shared -- is a responsibility of government every bit as important as monetary and fiscal policy. If the intricate system of incentives to create new ideas is underdeveloped, society suffers from the general lack of progress (most of all, the poor). (xvii)

...the power of mathematical methods. They state problems more clearly and solve them with greater clarity and persuasive power than any other method, he asserts -- including field trips to factories, or sifting through great quantities of data. He describes the process. **The evidence of the senses is where the theorist must begin, moving then to verbal description, to theorizing, and up to formal math in a steadily ascending arc of ever greater generality -- and then back down again from high abstraction to verbal formulation and the evidence of the real world.** This last setp checks the math, he says. (22)

What we look for in an explanation, said [Adam] Smith, is "a connecting principle" between apparently unrelated events. Science is a search for the "invisible chains which bind together all these discordant objects" with the precision of a physical mechanism, because "systems in many respects resemble machines." The trick of achieving an explanation, therefore, is to create a mental model, an "imaginary machine" of ever greater power and suitability, until all the causes and effects in question are worked out and mystery is dispelled. "Who wonders at the machinery of the opera house who has once been admitted behind the scenes?" (33)

Here is the first glimpse of what it since has come to mean to "think like an economist": **to see the world as a vast system of interdependent and essentially self-regulating markets in which prices constitute an automatic feedback mechanism coordinating the allocation of resources -- land, labor, and capital -- among competing uses.** (42)

At a certain point, Ricardo wrote to his friend, "**Political economy you think is an enquiry into the nature and causes of wealth -- I think it should be called an enquiry into the laws which determine the division of the produce of industry among the classes who concur in its formation. No law can be laid down respecting the quantity, but a tolerably correct one can be laid down respecting proportions.** Every day I am more satisfied the former enquiry is vain and delusive, and the latter is the only true object of the science." (56)

But for a few dacades there had been 'an extended period in which improved technique actually led to some loss of knowledge'. Something of the sort happened occasionally in economics, according to Krugman. "Economics understandably and inevitably follows the line of least mathematical resistance," he observed. "**Because universal diminishing returns were both intuitively appealing and easy to express mathematically, economists concentrated on their implications. They ignored countervailing forces that were far less easy to describe.**" (59-60)

## Overarching Trends

[wrt "Endogenous Technological Change"] The first paragraph contained a sentence that was intially more puzzling than not: "The distinguishing feature of ... technology as input is that it is neither a conventional good nor a public good; it is a nonrival, partially excludable good..." (xvi)

his [Solow's] basic innovation was to make his model of production depend on substitution. In the Domar model there had been no possibility of substituting labor for capital in production. The ratios were fixed, and steady growth occurred only under certain rigid specified conditions. Solow replaced the fixed capital/output ratio of the Harrod and Domar models with the relatively new concept of a variable production function, whose advantages were twofold. The convention permitted producers to shift back and forth, using capital when labor was too expensive and vice versa. As a result, no longer did the model present a knife-edge problem. The new mechanism also accomodated a term determined outside the model -- a parameter, a "given" -- that described the rate of technical change. (143)

## Random Interesting Stuff

One of the things that set Adam Smith apart from all other writers on economics was his formidable power of concentration. As a result, stories about his absentmindedness abound. How he walked out for air in his nightshirt and didn't stop for fifteen miles. How he thrust a slice of bread and butter into a teapot, poured in, waited, poured out -- and complained of the quality of the tea. His friend Alexander Carlyle said, "He was the most absent man in Company that I ever saw, moving his lips and talking to himself and Smiling, in the midst of large Company's. If you awakened him from his Reverie, and made him attend the Subject of Conversation, he immediately began a Harangue and never stopped till you he told you all he knew about it, with the utmost Philosophical Ingenuity." Presumably all the while he was silent since he was thinking, thinking, tracing through long chains of causation. (29)

The possibilities of marginalism were given their fullest statement by the French economist Walras -- "the Ricardo of the calculus era," as he had been called. He was born in 1834 and prepared extensively for the Ecole Polytechnique, reading Descartes, Newton, Lagrange, and Cournot. Twice he failed to gain admittance to France's top school, but he slept with a copy of Louis Poinsot's *Elements de statique* by his bed for decades, and, after a galvanizing walk one day in 1858 with his father (himself an amateur economist), Walras resolved to do for economics what engineers already had done for various intricate physical systems -- that is, construct a model fo economic general equilibrium from among the relevant interdependent variables. (70)

It turned out N. Bourbaki was no person at all, but rather a group of French mathematicians who wrote elaborate graduate texts and ascribed their authorship to a mythical retired army general. Their enthusiasm inspired a craze for formalism among mathematicians that in the 1950s and 1960s spread even to American grade schools in the form of "the new math" -- set theory for kindergartners.
