# Diffie-Hellman Problem (DHP)
> The motivation for this problem is that many security systems use one-way functions: mathematical functions that are fast to compute, but hard to reverse i.e. enable encrypting a message, but reversing the encryption (without the decryption key) is difficult. If solving DHP were easy, these systems would be broken. 

The **Diffie-Hellman Problem (DHP)** is stated informally as:<br>
Given an element `$g$` amd the values of `$g^{x}$` amd `$g^{y}$`, what is the value of `$g^{xy}$`?<br>
`$g$` is a generator of some group and `$x$` and `$y$` are randomly chosen integers.
