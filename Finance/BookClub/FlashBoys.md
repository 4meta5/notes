How was it legal for a handful of insiders to operate at faster speeds than the rest of the market and, in effect, steal from investors? Reg NMS

Back when human beings sat in the middle of the stock market, the spreads between the bids and the offers of any given stock were a sixteenth of a percentage point. Now that computers did the job, the spread, at least in the more actively traded stocks, was typically a penny, or one-hundredth of 1 percent. That, said the supporters of high-frequency trading, was evidence that more HFT meant more liquidity...A distinction cried to be made, between "trading activity" and "liquidity."

Many years later, when he had plenty of computer time, Serge still wrote out new programs in paper before typing them into the machine. "In Russia, time on the computer was measured in minutes," he said "When you write a program, you are given a tiny time slot to make it work. Consequently we learned to write the code in ways that minimized the amount of debugging...Good Russian programmers tend to have had that one experience at some time in the past--the experience of limited access to computer time."

there were three activities that led to a vast amount of grotesquely unfair trading...electronic front-running...rebate arbitrage...slow market arbitrage (page 172 for more info)

"I hate them a lot less than before we started," said Brad. "This is not their fault. I think most of them have just rationalized that the market is creating the inefficiencies and they are just capitalizing on them. Really, it's brilliant what they have done within the bounds of the regulation. They are much less of a villain than I thought. The system has let down the investor."

To the well-informed jury, the real mystery wasn't why Serge had done what he had done. It was why Goldman Sachs had done what it had done. Why on earth call the FBI? Why exploit the ignorance of the general public and the legal system about complex financial matters to punish this one little guy? Why must the spider always eat the fly?
