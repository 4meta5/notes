# Pet Peeves

These are a few of my pet peeves.

## Annoying Logical Fallacies
* using personal anecdotes to shut down a conversation
    - i.e. I am "blank" and I feel "blank" so if you keep talking, you're being disrespectful to me
* ridiculous analogies
    - ben shapiro is the master of these (he's great both pointing out when other people abuse analogies and then using abusive hyperbole to make his own points)
* ad hominem 
* quoting someone to justify a point (like opposite of ad hominem)

## Attachment to Grades/School
This goes along with the below article.

## Not Realizing How the World Is Changing
Everyone should read [The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) by Tim Urban.

Good example is people who decide to become a doctor. This might be the worst investment someone could make given how the world is changing.
