## UVA Investment Clubs
In the Fall of 2015, I joined the [McIntire Investment Fund](https://miiuva.com/). I was *rejected* by the more exclusive [Alternative Investment Fund](https://www.aifatuva.com/), but determined to gain admission the next semester. This was the first of many rejections for me in college and I'm glad it happened -- *I learn a lot more from failures than my successes*. One of the key lessons that I learned from my AIF interview was to not leave the interview up to chance. More specifically, I realized that even if I maintained thorough knowledge of certain trends/concepts within finance, success in the interview was dependent upon the interviewer asking questions to which I knew the answer; I needed to give myself better odds.

In the Spring of 2016, I reapplied to the Alternative Investment Fund. Instead of leaving the odds of acceptance up to the chance that the interviewers would ask me about a topic I understood, I presented a [pitch](../Finance/vlo_pitch.pdf) that I prepared over the winter break to short Valero Energy. By effectively demonstrating my knowledge, the pitch earned me a spot in the club. Moreover, I used the constructive criticism from the interview to *refine* my pitch and won the UVA Stock Pitch Competition a few weeks later. 

> As Truman Capote once said, "failure is the condiment that gives success it's flavour."

## Collateralized Internships <a name="collateral"><a/>
The summer after my first year, I spent three weeks studying Alternative Investments at the London School of Economics (LSE). This experience exposed me to asset classes outside of equities. In addition, I learned important lessons about bias and the risks of having high-conviction opinions based on few signals. I bet a few hundred pounds on 'Remain' on the basis of perceived sentiment in London. When Brexit was announced, I was surprised, but I also became aware of bias based on local environment. I had ignored the possibility of a large turnout from rural areas that opposed EU membership because I had only listened to Londoners (who generally favored EU membership).

> Interestingly, I made a very similar mistake when betting on the 2016 election (via predictit.org)

After gaining exposure to esoteric asset classes through my study at LSE, I interned at [LCR Capital Partners](https://www.lcrcapital.com/) in Connecticut. During this internship, I presented pitches recommending investments in premium muni bonds (based on low rate environment), senior tranches of CLOs (based on high yield spreads relative to similarly rated corporate debt), and aircraft ABS (based on low default rates). The experience made me aware of the intricacies of structured credit and motivated me to continue studying collateralized debt models.

> Interestingly, collateralized debt models are very similar to staking models in the blockchain space (where I am now)

The next summer, I interned at Fitch Ratings in New York City in the CLO and Corporate Debt groups. After already learning about structured credit from the perspective of a buy-side investor, I was interested in understanding how the credit rating agencies quantified risk for these assets. 

> To be honest, I wasn't super impressed (most models just gauge simple measures of correlation between the underlying loans...no magic here), but I did get decent at Excel (which some might say is a generally useful skill).

## (Rejected by) McIntire School of Commerce <a name="rejected"></a>

In the spring of 2017, I was rejected in the first round of admissions by the [UVA McIntire School of Commerce](https://www.commerce.virginia.edu/). More so than any of my previous failures, this rejection taught me invaluable lessons about friendship, honesty, and responsibility. 

When I attended an Alternative Investment Fund meeting the subsequent week, I was asked by the sector manager if I had been accepted. This wasn't a rude question in the context of the club (which maintained a near 100% acceptance rate to McIntire), but I still hadn't planned for the situation (even though, in hindsight, it was inevitable). Too embarassed to identify myself as the only one in the room who had been rejected, I responded sheepishly that I was majoring in Math and Computer Science. When probed as to whether I had rescinded my application, I accepted this out even though it was a lie. To this day, I regret this lie and, from that day forward, I vowed to own my failures instead of hiding them. At the time, the following quote by Ray Dalio helped me realize my mistake:

> “It’s a basic reality that if you don’t experience the consequences of your actions, you’ll take less ownership of them.”

Ray Dalio's philosophy of owning your failures helped me realize the necessity of being open about my rejection. Through this experience, I lost social clout in the UVA finance community and, as a result, lost some '*friends*' as well.  Even so, it reinvigorated my drive and, indirectly, led me to welcome blockchain technology with open arms. Most importantly, it taught me to own my failures moving forward.

> *I was probably rejected for taking lots of math classes my first two years of college. Despite the adverse effect it had on my GPA, I took courses in Abstract Algebra, Advanced Linear Algebra, and Real Analysis. I don't regret this decision -- math is beautiful!*

## Federal Reserve Challenge <a name="fedchallenge"></a>

In the summer of 2016, I read *The Alchemy of Finance* by George Soros in which he discusses in detail how he broke the british pound. This fascinating story led me down a rabbit hole on the efficacy of central banks and monetary policy (more recently I came across a relevant [paper](https://paulromer.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WP-Trouble.pdf) by Paul Romer on this topic). As I worked my way up to the present, I became interested in radical new ideas for jumpstarting the economy (specifically, inflation) including Helicopter money and negative interest rates. 

To learn more about modern monetary policy, I decided to start a [Federal Reserve Challenge](https://www.newyorkfed.org/education/fedchallenge_college.html) team at UVA in the Fall of 2016. The Fed Challenge competition consists of a 20 minute presentation on the state of the US economy alongside a monetary policy recommendation, followed by 10 minutes of Q&A. 

 After reaching out to [Professor Carter Doyle](http://economics.virginia.edu/people/profile/cad7q), we formed the team based on interviews with a few of his top students (6 students including myself). Over the past three years, I have enjoyed growing alongside the students on the team. The significant time commitment involved with preparation brought us closer together every year, and I have a feeling I will remain friends with some of my teammates long after I graduate from UVA. Through this experience, I came to better understand the art of effective incentive management and motivation. Although it's easy to read about leadership strategies, I learned the most through trial and error.
