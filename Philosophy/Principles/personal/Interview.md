# Interview Stuff


## Questions to Ask When Interviewing Others

1. Are you good at lying?
> you want them to say yes, but there will probably be some hesitation

2. What is one thing that you believe that other people don't believe?
* family is a social construct 
* Music is designed to make the masses stupid; it is comforting because it prevents unique thought by allowing your brain to go on auto pilot (consider the repitiveness of contemporary rap and pop) 
    * charts determine what music is popular, not the other way around
* Social media has led to our regression as a species; specifically social media => ADHD => smaller neocortex => inability to logic beyond a few simple steps => arguments primarily rooted in emotion
* Unhealthy food makes people both stupid and fat (which encourages a *dangerous* negative feedback loop)

3. < Present a false choice (neither answer is correct) and see if they catch it. >

4. Discuss the benefits of social media
* we're looking for someone who brings up how there are more harms than good -- this acts as a filtering question (see if someone is hip to the *brainwashing*) as well as a test of whether someone thinks for themselves and doesn't just cater to the question asker

## Behavioral

1. Biggest weakness
* I ask a lot of questions when I don't understand something so I think often times when I'm acclimating to a new environment or position, people will characterize me as dumb because my questions may come off as overly simple. This can *hurt* first impressions, which last in many cases.

2. Greatest strength
* not afraid to fail; don't set limits on myself and truly believe that I can achieve/learn anything
