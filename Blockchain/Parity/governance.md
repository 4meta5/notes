# [Insert Clever Governance Title Here]

We're going to use this podcast to discuss governance. 

> [Vlad and Gav go head-to-head on blockchain governance](https://www.zeroknowledge.fm/52)

SCOPE: focus on this podcast; don't make it too broad...point people to Steve D. McKie's article for a more extensive analysis on the spectrum of governance models!

## In defense of Vlad Zamfir

> rough consensus; keep things informal

— when I initially listened to vlad vs gav, I thought gav destroyed vlad. It seemed to me at the time that Vlad was conservative and Gav was progressive.

— recently reading Cyperpunks, and on page 106, I came across something that made me reevaluate my previous interpretation of the conversation. When we formalize governance prematurely, we disenfranchise future stakeholders and take away potentially more efficient, informal governance mechanisms that may arise organically from stakeholder interaction with the system (blockchain in this case).

— there’s a balance here that needs to be considered, and this balance is important. Goldilocks principle...in my opinion, the best approach will be a diversity of networks with different shades of formalized governance. See McKie and Pruitt recent blog post.

— consider the limitations of coinholder voting for blockchain governance decisions.
——Parity Light Protocol is designed to incorporate light clients and may entail incentivizing full nodes via micropayment models. Parity’s substrate protocol also utilizes Collators in addition to Validators; these collators are also tasked as fishermen. In the future, we don’t know what kinds of stakeholders may surface, and, if we restrict voice in the context of governance to coinholders, then we preemptively disenfranchise these future stakeholder groups, thereby limiting what we can achieve in the future. The best way forward is to try and expand our options — this is also the best strategy in chess.

**Advantages**
* prevents preemptively formalizing governance <=> disenfranchising future stakeholders

**Disadvantages**
* gridlock
* centralization in power; Hudson Jameson LOL

## Polkadot's Approach

> Can we make governance dynamic such that we formalize governance, while still enabling the changes necessary to progress and update in a smooth way? 

> "any governance that depends on high turnout is doomed to fail" - Fredrik

Discussion of adaptive quorum biasing -- pros and cons?

One counterargument is that current stakeholders rarely have the incentive to cede power or change the existing power structure.
