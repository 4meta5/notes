# College

I want to expand on this and basically make the argument that the nature of college makes us inadequate at teaching students how to teach themselves. There is a way to get around this; by changing the teaching paradigm and encouraging heterogeneous assignments.

The barriers to entry for most careers have become almost entirely artificial. The internet has made it so that anyone can teach themselves the skills necessary for any career. Laziness is no excuse.

Because our educational system is hung up on precision, the art of being good at approximations is insufficiently valued. This impedes conceptual thinking. For example, when asked to multiply 38 by 12, most people do it the slow and hard way rather than simply rounding 38 up to 40, rounding 12 down to 10, and quickly determining that the answer is about 400.

How can we consider a psychology intro class as difficult as a 4000 level Math/Physics/CS class? How can we so blatantly ignore class difficulty when determining GPA? I admit that there's no real way to solve this problem, but it doesn't mean that we should continue placing trust in a broken system.
