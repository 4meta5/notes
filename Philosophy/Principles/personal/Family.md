# *Family*
> some say family should be valued above all else, but this doesn't make much sense if your family is abusive and doesn't respect your aspirations/goals

> Often times people say that bad relationships with family is a red flag; maybe this is true in general and it may even be true for me. Unlike others, I don't take relationships for granted because I understand the mutual respect necessary for healthy relationships. I have only learned this through the experience of being in relationships in which there is no mutual respect.

* I don't need to document everything that's happened, but I shouldn't forget. These people support me in name only and have held me back for far too long.

* These outsiders don't know what's going in within my nuclear family; it may be uncomfortable to discuss but my experience is not your experience.

> I'll make a family with my friends. I've already made life-long friends in Phil, Julian, Ben.
