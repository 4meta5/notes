A record of messages received that are kept in the state. IoT devices that are listening can get consensus proofs, which are fairly cheap, of finality of some block and then get cheap merkle proofs of some messages that are received. Some notifications of what happened. Those notifications could've come from any other chain in the system. You could have a transaction that is broadcast to this chain that triggers a message to another chain. Opens up the entire network of chains, which is collectively capable of doing complex computation and maintaining complex state to a very low bandwith IoT device.

You could have low bandwidth devices, which listen for events from this huge network of chains which are doing a lot of work and still be able to see the computation and farm it out themselves.
