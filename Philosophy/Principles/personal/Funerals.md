# Why I Don't Go to Funerals

* Before anything else, let me get this one out of the way. Funerals are for the people who are alive who cared about the person who died and need a formal event to grieve over their death. Funerals are not for the person who is dead because the person who is dead is dead. This may be hard to come to terms with, but it is the reality of the situation.
* With that in mind, attendance at funerals is by no means necessary

## Don't Project

* it is not OK to project your emotions onto others by faulting them for not expressing their grief in an open way; people grieve differently and your sadness does not justify aggressive actions towards others

## My Choice

Before I explain my thought process behind not attending funerals, let me preface this by explaining that I don't owe anyone a justification for not going to funerals. I'm explaining myself because I feel like it, NOT because you deserve an explanation. We've already [explained](#project) that everyone grieves differently so you have no right to make any claim with respect to how someone feels based on their outward behavior.

* my basic point is that funerals are VERY DEPRESSING; they don't make me feel better, they make me feel worse...maybe other people like this feeling and consider it to be closure, but I don't need it and it only makes me feel shittier. 
    * just like laughter is contagious, so is crying
