# Griefing Factor Analysis

In [The Triangle of Harm](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/07/16/triangle_of_harm.html), Vitalik reduces the relevant actors for blockchain security to the minority, the majority, and the protocol (ie users). With these actors in mind, Vitalik identifies four categories of attack:
1. Minority attacking the protocol
2. Minority attacking the majority
3. Majority attacking the protocol
4. Majority attacking the minority

The common example of (**1**) is a variation a double spend attack known as the *Finney attack* because it was named after Hal Finney, who suggested it [on the bitcoin talk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3441.msg48384#msg48384).
