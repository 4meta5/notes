# Prediction Market

Prediction markets use “the wisdom of the crowd” to determine the probability of a future outcome. The idea is
that the collective wisdom of a diverse group of independent individuals results in more accurate and unbiased
predictions than the prediction of an expert or small group of experts. Literature on the topic claims that while
individuals have unique biases, gathering the knowledge and opinions of many individuals cancels out these
individual biases, resulting in more robust and accurate predictions.
