# How to Talk About Serious Matters of Complexity with Models as Agents

Resource sharing is not easy. The *Tragedy of the Commons* depicts the social problems of common goods sharing: "Picture a pastor open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons...Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit -- in a world that is limited" - Garret J. Hardin, 1968

*Governing the Commons* by Elinor Ostrom

*The Logic of Collective Action* by Mancur L. Olson, 1965 -- members of large groups do not act according to a common interest unless motivated by personal economic or social gain, while small groups can act on shared objectives.

> "A conventional design task would then be to facilitate and enable such processes of self-organization by improving aspects of visual communication, product or interaction design."

## Diffractive Modeling

Diffractive modeling designs communication between the matter to understand the model and its user in a highly flexible, if not an agential manner. 
> Quantum physics showed us that "theoretical concepts are defined by the circumstance required for their measurement."

This means "that there is no unambiguous way to differentiate between the 'object' and the 'agencies of observation'." Not only is the user (inter)acting with the model, the model is acting back and becomes an agent. Model, user and creator are all, as agents, coupled to each other like in a menage a trois. As Henri Poincare showed, three interacting bodies generate nonlinear dynamics. A minor change in the condition of one of those three is agential upon the remaining two. Furthermore, as in quantum physics, where a particle can become a wave and vice versa, diffractive modelling is never static. Ideally, it is unfailingly experimental, slippery, strange, and peculiar; not sticking to one version of modelling, but constantly researching new forms of representation, aestheticization and sense-making. It therefore demands a lot of effort.
