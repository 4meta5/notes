## College <a name="college"></a>

## High School <a name="highschool"></a>

Notable books that I didn't put here include all of the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald. I may add a few of these later.

## Childhood <a name="childhood"></a>

Notable books that I didn't put here include all of Dan Brown's books, a few books by Tom Clancy (including Threat Vector), and the Artemis Fowl series. When I was really young, I was a big fan of the Magic Treehouse series.

* [Maniac Magee](#maniac) by Jerry Spinelli
* [Hatchet](#hatchet) by Gary Paulsen
* Summer Ball by Mike Lupica
* Travel Team by Mike Lupica

### Maniac Magee <a name="maniacmagee"></a>

> "Nobody knows who said it first, but somebody must have: 'Kid's gotta be a maniac.'"

> "His smile was so wide he'd have had to break it into sections to fit it through a doorway"

> "Inside his house, a kid gets one name, but on the other side of the door, it's whatever the rest of the world wants to call him."

### Hatchet <a name="hatchet"></a>

> "Patience, he thought. So much of this was patience - waiting, and thinking and doing things right. So much of all this, so much of all living was patience and thinking."

> "He did not know how long it took, but later he looked back on this time of crying in the corner of the dark cave and thought of it as when he learned the most important rule of survival, which was that feeling sorry for yourself didn't work. It wasn't just that it was wrong to do, or that it was considered incorrect. It was more than that--it didn't work." 

> "When he sat alone in the darkness and cried and was done, all done with it, nothing had changed. His leg still hurt, it was still dark, he was still alone and the self-pity had accomplished nothing.” 

> "That's all it took to solve problems - just sense.”
