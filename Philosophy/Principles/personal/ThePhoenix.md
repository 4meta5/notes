> later, add sound clips from conversation to corroborate my account; change the names as much as possible

> Note that I'm not claiming that this is an objective account. Rather, I want to make the point that it is wrong for people to interpret subjective perception as objective truth (which is what happened multiple times during these events). I give my account because I realize that it was missing.

* Why did I leave that friend group? 
    * Growing ambition -- think back to January; when I told Joe as well as Priya/Lily that I was very ambitious with respect to cryptography and blockchain
    * their obsession with sexual acts; constantly talking about the Rice Purity Test, etc; a lot of it made me uncomfortable and I definitely wasn't comfortable with Priya talking about her conquests in my presence, but this was encouraged by the others in the group

Accusation
* read red pill articles
* hearsay that I said I wanted to dominated Lily after matching with her on Tinder; (1) think of the source -- I don't mean to attack Lynn's validity, but it seems ironic that she is a trusted source when her story is convenient, while 2 years earlier, she cheated on Priya's CS homeworks and was discredited then from being trustworthy.
* recharacteriion of night when priya came to my room...if we review that night, we remember that no one's clothes came off, my pants stayed on and so did hers; what we did that night was mild relative to what we'd done in the past
    * I remember her saying "I wish I wasn't wearing jeans", but nobody's clothes came off and all we did was kiss and roll around on the bed. There were moments when I was on top of her and moments when she was on top of me, but everything was very mild relative to what we had done in the past. I made no effort to take things further and she didn't either.
    * I also remember when she left, she wouldn't let go of me when we were hugging. Having had feelings for this girl for a few years, this whole thing was very confusing for me. I don't understand how she allowed her memories to be manipulated in such a negative way.
* Eileen later brings up an event first year where I touched her at a party (3 years ago)...I don't remember it and apologize, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

Response
* other people are transitively creeped out by me and spread the false lies
* priya apparently made claims that there have been more occurrences in the past (putting me at significant risk given the countless times we've hooked up in the past)
* I was called Kavanaugh, in the midst of the Kavanaugh trial

> multiple times when I started to talk I was cut off by Eileen, and I knew that I was supposed to just allow her to speak because otherwise I would be 'mans-plaining'; when they entered the room they told me that the cardinal rule was 'no yelling', which was condescending and presumptuous. Minutes into the conversation, Eileen started yelling. It's interesting how when the other side yells, it's perceived as passion, but if I yell, it's perceived as abuse. 

> consider recharacterizing this assuming the circumstances are worse; at the time, it was tough for me to lose all of these friends => I actually ended up dropping out of school because I couldn't handle the toxic environment. In the end, I think the whole thing effected me a lot more than it effected any of them

My Response
* this was the best thing that ever happened to me
    * it removed all the negative influences from my life
    * it taught me how to ignore what the people around me think
    * it gave me an excuse to drop out of school for all the weak people that surrounded me
* decided it was against my best interests to
    * hang out with anyone who talked behind my back during the entire ordeal
    * stop going out at UVA
    * to never use Tinder again

> I want to consider the fact that they stopped attacking me only after they realized that nothing was happening in my life. I was relatively secluded and isolated -- there was nothing for them to take away. If this ever comes into the limelight, I should mention that my response was to stop putting myself in situations conducive to similar miscommunication in the future...the events of that night had seemingly no effect on the frequency with which this group and the accuser *went out* that semester
