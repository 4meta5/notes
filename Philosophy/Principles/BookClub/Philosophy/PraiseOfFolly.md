# Praise of Folly
> by Erasmus

And what am I to say about those who enjoy deluding themselves with imaginary pardons for their sins?

> Had I a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths,
> A voice of iron, I could not count the types 
> Of fool, nor yet enumerate the names
> Of every kind of folly.

And that 'great theologian' had sweated eight whole months over this discourse, so today he is blinder than a mole, all his keenness of sight doubtless gone to reinforce the sharp edge of his intellect. But the man has no regrets for his lost sight; he even thinks it was a small price to pay for his hour of glory.

I don't want to look as though I'm writing satire when I should be delivering a eulogy, nor anyone to think that in praising bad princes I mean to censure good ones. I touched briefly on these matters only to make it clear that no mortal can live honestly unless he is initiated in my rites and is sure of my favours.

the supreme reward for man is no other than a kind of madness. First consider how Plato imagined something of this sort when he wrote that the madness of lovers is the highest form of happiness. For anyone who loves intensely lives not in himself but in the object of his love, and the further he can move out of himself into his love, the happier he is. Now, when the soul is planning to leave the body and cease to make proper use of its organs, it is thought to be mad, and doubtless with good reason...What, then, will life in heaven be like, to which all pious minds so eagerly aspire?

And so when the whole man will be outside himself, and be happy for no reason except that he is so outside himself, he will enjoy some ineffable share in the supreme good which draws everything into itself. Although this perfect happiness can only be experienced when the soul has recovered its former body, and been granted immortality, since the life of the pious is no more than a contemplation and foreshadowing of that other life, at times they are able to feel some foretaste and savour of the reward to come. It is only the tiniest drop in comparison with the fount of eternal bliss, yet it far exceeds all pleasures of the body, even if all mortal delights were rolled into one, so much does the spiritual surpass the physical, the invisible the visible...And this is the party of Folly which is not taken away by the transformation of life but is made perfect.
