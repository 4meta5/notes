# Principles
> "Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can't stop our movement down this river and we can't avoid those encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way." - [Principles](https://www.principles.com/) by Ray Dalio

Inspired by Ray Dalio's book [Principles](https://www.principles.com/), I have started to organize my own life principles/values, most important of which include:
1. Radical Open Mindedness
2. Thoughtful Disagreement
3. Pain + Reflection = Progress

# Blockchain
> "When we remove the gatekeepers that babysit every state transition [within an application], we can create very novel mechanisms to effectively harness collective intelligence." ~ Gavin Wood, Parity Technology London Meet-Up

# Economics
> "To put it bluntly, the discipline of economics has yet to get over its childish passion for mathematics and for purely theoretical and often highly ideological speculation, at the expense of historical research and collaboration with the other social sciences." - Thomas Picketty, [Capital in the 21st Century](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674979857)

# RadicalXChange
> "In the present stage of technological and economic development, when cooperation has grown too large to be managed by moral economies, the market is the appropriate computer to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. If we see it as such, we can fix the bugs in the market's code and enable it to generate more wealth that is distributed more fairly." - [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com/) by Eric Posner, E. Glen Weyl

I am committed to realizing the Radical Markets vision via the RadicalXChange movement (led by E. Glen Weyl). In this folder, I have organized my [notes](./RadicalXChange/RadicalMarkets.md) on the book, [ideas](./RadicalXChange/Ideas.md) motivated by the book, and thoughts on related topics (like QV, Liberal Radicalism, etc).

# Cryptography
> "If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy." - Phil Zimmerman, [Why I Wrote PGP](https://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html)

Cryptography is empowering -- if used correctly, it will liberate individuals from institutional tyranny and contribute to a massive rebalancing of power. 

Aside from the positive impact this field has wrt securing individual liberty, I also enjoy the aesthetics of the pure mathematics often used to build secure, durable cryptosystems.

# CV
> "By the time a student gets to college, he’s spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse résumé to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he’s ready—-for nothing in particular." - Peter Thiel, [0 to 1](http://zerotoonebook.com/)
