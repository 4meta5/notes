# Ideas

Place for me to keep my ideas; each of these ideas may be put into a different file once they are more concrete.

* self-funded hackathons (with some entry fee that is used to fund the prize money; participants vote on the best project and cannot vote on their own project)
* Tiny Conferences (solving coordination problems to enable mini conferences; this could be very useful among collaborating companies/orgs if like the teams that were working together from each org did something like this)
* changing how the research screening process works by incorporating QV (could even apply such a system to RFCs and other Improvement Proposal systems)
* Database Curation is of course a huge use case of any collective intelligence governance mechanism
* Radical HR (combine stuff from Dalio and incorporate the RM mechanisms?)

* TCR design pattens 
    * SimonDLR
    * Cryptosystems at Consensys (Levels)
    * Mike Goldin
