## Blind Spots
> everyone has some blind spots; I have a few!

* mesh networks
* token bonding curves (and ODE tbh) (Trent Mconaughy, SimonDLR, and others...NEED TO CREATE MY GRAPH)
* decentralized storage (look at ZeroKnowledgeFM podcasts)
* outsourcing computation to off-chain (Truebit)
* decentralized loan pool protocols -- I have an interest
* mining pool protocols (loi luu's protocol)
* DAGS
    * GHOST to SPECTRE: single-winner abstract voting rule --> multi-winner abstract voting rule, yielding more robust consensus properties.
    * SPECTRE to PHANTOM: pairwise ordering --> linear ordering, achieved by additional assumption on network delay *upper bound*
    * SpaceMesh
* randomness beacons (collective coin flipping, dfinity threshhold scheme, randao)
* fork choice rules
* **the concept of rent in the context of blockchains**
