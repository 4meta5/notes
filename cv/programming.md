# Programming

Right now, I am focusing on learning Rust. I've started to organize my justification for learning Rust in a [lecture](https://github.com/AmarRSingh/CS1501/blob/master/6/lecture.md) that I'm giving at the University of Virginia on October 19, 2018 (for the CS1501 Introduction to Blockchain Class I teach).

> I plan to add more content here about my experiences with JavaScript and Golang

> I also want to learn a functional language soon (either Haskell or OCaml probably), but I won't write about that until I'm further along.
