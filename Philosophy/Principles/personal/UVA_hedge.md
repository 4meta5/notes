During time away from the university during the Fall 2018 semester, I have enjoyed the opportunity to reflect on my college experience. Although the circumstances surrounding my departure from UVA were not necessarily positive, I have learned a lot from my time off, and am glad that I got the opportunity to reorient myself before returning.

After my initial departure, I reflected on my long-term goals and objectives in order to create a more coherent short to medium term plan regarding which skills I need to develop. This reflection led to me committing more time to learning the Rust programming language in preparation for the launch of the Polkadot blockchain protocol in Q3 2019. Over the past few months, I have spent roughly 3-4 hours every day coding in Rust in order to make this one of my foundational skills. Developing talent requires hard work and consistent practice; my time off has granted me the opportunity to focus on this core skill to better prepare myself for my career post-graduation. 

I have also used this time to reflect on how I can better deal with negative outside pressure in the future. I realize that life is full of obstacles and it is unrealistic to assume that I won't encounter similar roadblocks in the future. As part of my reflection, I have taken up transcendental meditation, twice a day (in the morning and at night). Transcendental meditation consists of essentially clearing my mind to reorient myself when I wake up and before I go to sleep. Through this practice, I have learned how to manage stress as well as properly insulate myself from toxic outside influence. 

Upon further reflection, I have also incorporated healthier lifestyle choices, both for physical and mental health. Eating healthier and getting more sleep has given me more energy to do things that I want to do and sustain a positive mood. In addition, I have surrounded myself with uplifting people that make me feel better about myself and more optimistic about the world. I now realize the importance of being selective with friends in order to ensure that I maintain a positive outlook on life. 

I will use the lessons I've learned during this semester away from UVA upon my return next semester. I am excited to complete my undergraduate degree and continue preparing for a bright future.
