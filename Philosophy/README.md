## Principles
> "Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can't stop our movement down this river and we can't avoid those encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way." - [Principles](https://www.principles.com/) by Ray Dalio

I have organized lists of [Articles](./Principles/Articles.md), [Books](./Principles/Books.md), and [Papers](./Principles/Papers.md) that have had a significant impact on how I perceive the world and live my life. Inspired by Ray Dalio, I have also started to catalogue [my own life principles/values](./Principles/Principles.md), most important of which include:
1. Radical Open Mindedness
2. Thoughtful Disagreement
3. Pain + Reflection = Progress
