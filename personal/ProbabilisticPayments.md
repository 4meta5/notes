# Incentive Management with Probabilistic Payments

There have been many layer 2 scaling proposals that demonstrate creative new applications of the sparse merkle tree to manage state transitions off-chain (ie [Plasma Cash](https://blog.ujomusic.com/a-plasma-cash-primer-27dcfd1d5ddc)). Many of these constructions enable provably probabilistic payments. We can dive deeper into incentives to understand how this could be useful.
