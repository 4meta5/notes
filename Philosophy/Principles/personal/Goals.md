# Goals

## Rust

> Parity

> Playground

Goals:
* make one crate per month in 2019 (focus on `async/await` and `futures`)
* make three modules for the srml in 2019
* work on Radical Markets parachain applications for Polkadot
* I want to write a book on Polkadot and/or Parity/substrate

TODO:
* learn LOTS
    * parachain requirements (independent of srml and substrate)
    * learn futures and async/await
    * learn code patterns
* think of (1) module ideas and (2) crate ideas; keep (3) parachain code implementation patterns in mind (and consider how to convert to an effective Rust code pattern)

## Writing
> 4 hours minimum (subject to change once work starts)

Goals:
1. Book
2. A6: Newsletter, Pitches
3. Writing for (1) Parity and (2) Radical Markets

TODO:
* EVERYDAY write for the Book
* set a schedule for A6 Newsletters (use the links I send myself)

## Math
> 1 hour a day minimum

1. elliptic curve notes
    * think critically about how to build protocols using elliptic curves (use MW as a reference)
    * Rust reference implementations for increased clarity
2. Algebraic Geometry (one step at a time...)
