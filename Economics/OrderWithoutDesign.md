# Order without Design (How Markets Shape Cities)
> by Alain Bertraud

**NOTE TO SELF**: remote work will effect the dynamics described in this book

The job of an urban planner is in many ways like that of a family doctor who tries to heal the illnesses of patients and advise them on how to maintain a healthy life in the future. Nobody would trust a doctor who has only one patient...To acquire the necessary urban knowledge, an urban planner must live a nomadic life for an extended time.

This book is about the observed interaction between economic markets and design in the development of a few cities around the world...Markets are impersonal, transactional mechanisms resulting from human action but not from human design...The order created by markets manifests itself in the shape of cities. Markets transmit through prices the information generating the spatial order. When prices are distorted, so is the order generated by markets.

Auditing urban regulations is like periodically pruning a tree: the objective is not to cut branches but to allow the tree to develop fully.

Planners and engineers like to reason in terms of "needs", while urban economists think in terms of scarce resource allocation.

While most cities offer a lot more than job opportunities, it is important to recognize that the expansion of job markets makes everything else possible. A well-functioning labor market brings together people with varied by complementary knowledge and skills -- the preconditions for innovation.

Economists have convincingly demonstrated the productivity advantage of larger cities over smaller ones. Large cities generate economies of scale that allows enterprises to reduce their cost by increasing output, thereby reducing costs per unit. Economies of scale are only possible in cities with a large labor market. When many related activities are located in close proximity, they generate what economists call "knowledge spillovers". (page 21; the 2009 World Bank Development Report "Reshaping Economic Geography" and the report of the Commission on Growth and Development "Urbanization and Growth" exhaustively summarize and document the theoretical and empirical arguments justifying the economic advantage provided by the spatial concentration of economic activities in larger cities)

In spite of the prospect of higher productivity, only some types of firms can benefit from moving to a larger city. Firms established in larger cities require greater capital and higher operation and maintenance costs than those located in smaller cities. Land and rents are more expensive in larger cities than in smaller ones. Distances traveled are longer, and the "congestion tax" is higher. In addition, not every enterprise can benefit from economies of scale or agglomeration economies.

The rate of a city's population growth cannot be attributed to advance planning. Instead it is due to a combination of exogenous and endogenous circumstances. To the chagrin of urban planners, a city's growth rate over the mid or long term is largely unpredictable, and it is futile to pretend it is the result of careful planning.

In countries and regions, a natural equilibrium is reached between the size of the population and the firms choosing to settle in small, medium and large cities. This equilibrium is created by the accumulated decisions of firms and households to "vote with their feet", thereby selecting to move to the cities that will grow and to leave the cities or villages that have less potential. The spontaneous spatial equilibrium created by the sum of uncoordinated, individual decisions illustrate the principle of *Order without Design*

## Rules/Trends

Land prices decreased as one got further away from city centers. When land prices were high, households and firms consumed less land and as a consequence, population density increased. While the objective of urban planning regulations was nearly always to limit densities, I noticed that they had very little success in doing so when the price of land was high compared to household income.

Better land use and transport improve the way that labor markets function, allowing for the core indispensable values of urban life:
* a commute short enough that one has time for leisure activities
* an open job market that allows one to change jobs and -- through trial and error -- find a job that best suits
* a residence from which access to social life or nature is quick and easy

**The Proportion of Smaller Cities to Large Ones Stay Constant over Time: On Average, All Grow at about the Same rate** (page 21, I may disagree with this but it is a generalization so it's easy to attack anyway)

To increase productivity, a city must have certain preconditions:
1. Firms and households must have the freedom to stay put or migrate at will
2. Travel within the city remains fast and cheap
3. Real estate is sufficiently affordable such that it does not distort the allocation of labor

**A City's Productivity Depends on its Ability to Maintain Mobility as Its Built-Up Area Grows**

### Transportation

In their 2009 book, aptly titled *Mobility First*, Sam Staley and Adrian Moore describe in detail the cross-disciplinary reforms in road and urban transport design and in road pricing, among other things, that would be required to maintain mobility in cities in the twenty first century.

Failure to manage urban transportation in a manner that maintains mobility results in congestion. Congestion decreases labor mobility and productivity and is in fact avoidable in large cities. Its presence represents a failure on the part of city managers. Congestion has a dual negative effect: it acts as a tax on productivity by tying down people and goods, and it degrades the environment and increases greenhouse gas emissions..the economic advantage of spatial concentration can be offset by congestion

**Commuting Time and Commuting Cost Limit the Size of Labor Markets**
Because the time spent commuting is a dead loss for both individuals and employers, the size and efficiency of a labor market depends on how short, cheap, and comfortable the commute is. The maximum cost in time and cash that workers are willing to spend commuting will there dictate the size of the labor market and, by extension, the productivity of a city.
