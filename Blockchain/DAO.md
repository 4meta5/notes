# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
> DAOs provide an alternative to the strict, hierarchical structure of conventional organizations by leveraging the blockchain to enable novel mechanisms for collective intelligence.

## Highlights

For the first time in history, we will be able to experiment with different human governance models from the comfort of our chairs. In previous eras, trying out new governance models could end up very badly for society, even with wars or human catastrophes.

With the further integration of **pando** into the Aragon stack, we also hope to onboard new organizations into the Aragon DAO landscape by spinning content-DAOs out as a use case to the ecosystem and eventually to users beyond the blockchain space. We also will be working on enabling decentralized organizations to bootstrap their projects by lowering the cost of raising funds through the fundraising app. This mechanism to turn OS initiatives into financially sustainable and well-curated entities will create organic avenues for use case based on-boarding for Aragon.

Corporations have been the core driver of innovation from the industrial revolution till today, and to think that they havenâ€™t evolved at all is just plain crazy...This essentially means that the amount of innovation in the world today is constrained by these antiquated legal structures.
