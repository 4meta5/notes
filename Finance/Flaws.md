# Flaws

## Grievances
* facade of meritocracy when in reality it is far from it
* optics are over emphasized
* requirements of respect based on hierarchy and therefore the best ideas don't always win

### Why Other People Go Into Finance
> this is an excerpt from something

It is however a genuinely weird process for choosing a job. How can you know, after a few months of investment banking, that private equity will be what you want to do with your life in two years? “All of your lacrosse teammates are doing it” is one obvious but unsatisfactory answer: The young people for whom this process works best are the ones who are already pretty acculturated into the financial industry. But “everyone else in your analyst class is doing it and it’s not like you have any free time to consider other careers” is probably an even more common answer, and I am not sure how well it works for anyone.

Private equity is not so much like that. It’s more like a job, a career even. There are exit opportunities, of course, but the main function of the job is not to prepare you for other jobs. It is useful for private equity firms, though, that they have been able to plunk themselves down at the end of the conveyor belt. If you are a smart young person who has spent your life being funneled from one standard prestigious thing to the next without thinking too hard about what you want or what your skills are, the standard prestigious thing that you find yourself doing, at the end of the line, may well be private equity. Even if that’s not quite what you wanted.

## Exceptions and How to Do Finance Right
* Ray Dalio (Bridgewater)
    - radical transparency and openness
    - peer reviews, etc.

## How the World is Changing
* Blockchain (the role of banks will change)
* Hedge funds may be around still, but I expect a lot of disruption in this space as well
