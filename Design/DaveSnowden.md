"Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man." - Martin Heidegger

* Anne pendleton-julian (new design book coming out soon)

> exaptation (survival of the luckiest instead of survival of the fittest)

> adaptation based on where it started (the starting point determines the pathway forward)

> History of exaptive moments; you get novel innovation by repurposing old technology under conditions of stress.

> How do you design for serendipity?

"When you architect for complex systems, you design for early failure because only through early failure do you find out what is possible" ~ Dave Snowden

If you overly constrain a system that can't be naturally constrained, people will work around the constraints.
