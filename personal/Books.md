### Moby Dick <a name="mobydick"></a>

> Ignorance is the parent of fear.

> Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began. 
> Consider all this; and then turn to the green, gentle, and most docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half-known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst never return!

> To enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.

> Who ain’t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way— either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades, and be content.

> There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:-- through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling's father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.

### Praise of Folly <a name="praise"></a>

> And what am I to say about those who enjoy deluding themselves with imaginary pardons for their sins?

> Had I a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths,
A voice of iron, I could not count the types 
Of fool, nor yet enumerate the names
Of every kind of folly.

> And that 'great theologian' had sweated eight whole months over this discourse, so today he is blinder than a mole, all his keenness of sight doubtless gone to reinforce the sharp edge of his intellect. But the man has no regrets for his lost sight; he even thinks it was a small price to pay for his hour of glory.

> I don't want to look as though I'm writing satire when I should be delivering a eulogy, nor anyone to think that in praising bad princes I mean to censure good ones. I touched briefly on these matters only to make it clear that no mortal can live honestly unless he is initiated in my rites and is sure of my favours.

> the supreme reward for man is no other than a kind of madness. First consider how Plato imagined something of this sort when he wrote that the madness of lovers is the highest form of happiness. For anyone who loves intensely lives not in himself but in the object of his love, and the further he can move out of himself into his love, the happier he is. Now, when the soul is planning to leave the body and cease to make proper use of its organs, it is thought to be mad, and doubtless with good reason...What, then, will life in heaven be like, to which all pious minds so eagerly aspire?
> And so when the whole man will be outside himself, and be happy for no reason except that he is so outside himself, he will enjoy some ineffable share in the supreme good which draws everything into itself. Although this perfect happiness can only be experienced when the soul has recovered its former body, and been granted immortality, since the life of the pious is no more than a contemplation and foreshadowing of that other life, at times they are able to feel some foretaste and savour of the reward to come. It is only the tiniest drop in comparison with the fount of eternal bliss, yet it far exceeds all pleasures of the body, even if all mortal delights were rolled into one, so much does the spiritual surpass the physical, the invisible the visible...And this is the party of Folly which is not taken away by the transformation of life but is made perfect.

### Sophie's World <a name="sophie"></a>

> There are two kinds of philosophers. One is a person who seeks his own answers to philosophical questions. The other is someone who is an expert on the history of philosophy but does not necessarily construct his own philosophy.

> Kant had talked about something he called 'das Ding an sich'. Although he denied that man could have any clear cognition of the innermost secrets of nature, he admitted that there exists a kind of unattainable 'truth'. Hegel said that the 'truth is subjective,' thus rejecting the existence of any 'truth'  above or beyond human reason. All knowledge is human knowledge, he said.

> We usually say that the era of the great philosophical systems ended with Hegel. After him, philosophy took a new direction. Instead of great speculative systems, we had what we call an existential philosophy or a philosophy of action. This was what Marx meant when he observed that until now, 'philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.' These words mark a significant turning point in the history of philosophy.

> The key words from the middle of the last century were nature, environment, history, evolution, and growth. Marx had pointed out that human ideologies were a product of the basis of society. Darwin showed that mankind was the result of a slow biological evolution, and Freud's studies of the unconscious revealed that people's actions were often the result of 'animal' urges or instincts.

> Freud held that there is a constant tension between man and his surroundings. In particular, a tension--or conflict--between his desires and needs and the demands of society. It is no exaggeration to say that Freud discovered human drives. 
> Our actions are not always guided by reason. Man is not really such a rational creature as the eighteenth-century rationalists liked to think. Irrational impulses often determine what we think, what we dream, and what we do. Such irrational impulses can be an expression of basic drives or needs. The human sexual drive, for example, is just as basic as the baby's instinct to suckle.
> This in itself was no new discovery. But Freud showed that these basic needs can be disguised or 'sublimated,' thereby steering our actions without our being aware of it. 

> Another important philosopher who had a great influence on the twentieth century was the German *Friedrich Nietzsche*, who lived from 1844 to 1900. He, too, reacted against Hegel's philosophy and the German 'historicism.' He proposed life itself as a counterweight to the anemic interest in history and what he called the Christian 'slave morality.' He sought to effect a 'revaluation of all values,' so that the life force of the strongest should not be hampered by the weak. According to the Nietzsche, both Christianity and traditional philsophy had turned away from the real world and pointed toward 'heaven' or 'the world of ideas.' But what had hitherto been considered the 'real' world was in fact a pseudo world. 'Be true to the world,' he said. 'Do not listen to those who offer you supernatural expectations.'

### Catch 22 <a name="catch22"></a>

> There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.

> It was miraculous. It was almost no trick at all, he saw, to turn vice into virtue and slander into truth, impotence into abstinence, arrogance into humility, plunder into philanthropy, thievery into honor, blasphemy into wisdom, brutality into patriotism, and sadism into justice. Anybody could do it; it required no brains at all. It merely required no character.

> What is a country? A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural. Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia. There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war. Surely so many countries can't all be worth dying for.

> What a lousy earth! He wondered how many people were destitute that same night even in his own prosperous country, how many homes were shanties, how many husbands were drunk and wives socked, and how many children were bullied, abused, or abandoned. How many families hungered for food they could not afford to buy? How many hearts were broken? How many suicides would take place that same night, how many people would go insane? How many cockroaches and landlords would triumph? How many winners were losers, successes failures, and rich men poor men? How many wise guys were stupid? How many happy endings were unhappy endings? How many honest men were liars, brave men cowards, loyal men traitors, how many sainted men were corrupt, how many people in positions of trust had sold their souls to bodyguards, how many had never had souls? How many straight-and-narrow paths were crooked paths? How many best families were worst families and how many good people were bad people? When you added them all up and then subtracted, you might be left with only the children, and perhaps with Albert Einstein and an old violinist or sculptor somewhere.

> You know, that might be the answer – to act boastfully about something we ought to be ashamed of. That’s a trick that never seems to fail.

> He was going to live forever, or die in the attempt.

> Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.

> It doesn't make a damned bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.

> There was no telling what people might find out once they felt free to ask whatever questions they wanted to.

> Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre. Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three. Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as a man lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were always impressed by how unimpressive he was.

> Yossarian wrinkled his forehead with quizzical amusement. “You won’t marry me because I’m crazy, and you say I’m crazy because I want to marry you? Is that right?”

### The Old Man and The Sea <a name="oldsea"></a>

> First you borrow. Then you beg.

> The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it.

> Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish. I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many people. But then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin. It is much too late for that and there are other people who are paid to do it. Let them think about it. You were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish.

### A Random Walk Down Wall Street <a name="randomwalk"></a>

> Caveat 1: Expectations about the future cannot be proven in the present.

> Academic Attack 1: Theory Does Not Measure Up to Practice

> Future prices depend on the interest rate and storage costs. Moreover, one additional factor is likely to enter the equation--the so-called "convenience yield" of having the inventory directly on hand.

> There are four factors that create irrational market behavior: overconfidence, biased judgments, herd mentality, and loss aversion.

> Never buy anything from someone who is out of breath.

> A couple, both age seventy-eight, went to a sex therapist’s office. The doctor asked, “What can I do for you?” The man said, “Will you watch us have sexual intercourse?” The doctor looked puzzled, but agreed. When the couple finished, the doctor said, “There’s nothing wrong with the way you have intercourse,” and charged them $50. The couple asked for another appointment and returned once a week for several weeks. They would have intercourse, pay the doctor, then leave. Finally, the doctor asked, “Just exactly what are you trying to find out?” The old man said, “We’re not trying to find out anything. She’s married and we can’t go to her house. I’m married and we can’t go to my house. The Holiday Inn charges $93 and the Hilton Inn charges $108. We do it here for $50, and I get $43 back from Medicare."

> A firm’s income statement may be likened to a bikini—what it reveals is interesting but what it conceals is vital.

### Business Adventures <a name="adventures"></a>

> Never give anyone the advice to buy or sell shares, because, where perspicacity is weakened, the most benevolent piece of advice can turn out badly

> failure can have a certain granduer that success never knows

> By favoring capital gains over ordinary income, the Code seems to be putting forward two very dubious notions--that one form of unearned income is more deserving than any form of earned income, and that people with money to invest are more deserving than people without it.

> In August, 1968, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit handed down a decision...For the first time in the history of the world, the effort would have to be made, in Wall Street, to conduct a stock market without the use of a stacked deck.

> Actually, the breakdown is between the person and himself. If you're not able to communicate successfully between yourself and yourself, how are you supposed to make it with the strangers outside?

> Only a stock that many traders were selling short could be cornered; a stock that was in the throes of a real bear raid was ideal. In the latter situation, the would-be cornerer would attempt to buy up the investment houses' floating supply of the stock and enough of the privately held shares to freeze out the bears; if the attempt succeeded, when he called for the short sellers to make good the stock they had borrowed, they could buy it from no one but him. And they would have to buy it at any price he chose to ask, their only alternative--at least theoretically--being to go into bankrupty or to jail for failure to meet their obligations.

> "One of the core tenets of democracy...is a deep belief in civil liberties and their protection; and a repugnance to anyone who would steal from a human being that which is most precious to him, his good name, by imputing things to him, by innuendo, or by insinuation."~ David Eli Lilienthal (against McCarthyism)

### Flash Boys <a name="flash"></a>

> How was it legal for a handful of insiders to operate at faster speeds than the rest of the market and, in effect, steal from investors? Reg NMS

> Back when human beings sat in the middle of the stock market, the spreads between the bids and the offers of any given stock were a sixteenth of a percentage point. Now that computers did the job, the spread, at least in the more actively traded stocks, was typically a penny, or one-hundredth of 1 percent. That, said the supporters of high-frequency trading, was evidence that more HFT meant more liquidity...A distinction cried to be made, between "trading activity" and "liquidity."

> Many years later, when he had plenty of computer time, Serge still wrote out new programs in paper before typing them into the machine. "In Russia, time on the computer was measured in minutes," he said "When you write a program, you are given a tiny time slot to make it work. Consequently we learned to write the code in ways that minimized the amount of debugging...Good Russian programmers tend to have had that one experience at some time in the past--the experience of limited access to computer time."

> there were three activities that led to a vast amount of grotesquely unfair trading...electronic front-running...rebate arbitrage...slow market arbitrage (page 172 for more info)

> "I hate them a lot less than before we started," said Brad. "This is not their fault. I think most of them have just rationalized that the market is creating the inefficiencies and they are just capitalizing on them. Really, it's brilliant what they have done within the bounds of the regulation. They are much less of a villain than I thought. The system has let down the investor."

> To the well-informed jury, the real mystery wasn't why Serge had done what he had done. It was why Goldman Sachs had done what it had done. Why on earth call the FBI? Why exploit the ignorance of the general public and the legal system about complex financial matters to punish this one little guy? Why must the spider always eat the fly?

### The Big Short <a name="bigshort"></a>

> What are the odds that people will make smart decisions about money if they don't need to make smart decisions--if they can get rich making dumb decisions? The incentives on Wall Street were all wrong; they're still all wrong.

> “When you’re a conservative Republican, you never think people are making money by ripping other people off,” he said. His mind was now fully open to the possibility. “I now realized there was an entire industry, called consumer finance, that basically existed to rip people off.” 

> Charlie and Jamie had always sort of assumed that there was some grown-up in charge of the financial system whom they had never met; now, they saw there was not.

> Because the lenders sold many—though not all—of the loans they made to other investors, in the form of mortgage bonds, the industry was also fraught with moral hazard. “It was a fast-buck business,” says Jacobs. “Any business where you can sell a product and make money without having to worry how the product performs is going to attract sleazy people.” 

> If you wanted to predict how people would behave, Munger said, you only had to look at their incentives. FedEx couldn’t get its night shift to finish on time; they tried everything to speed it up but nothing worked—until they stopped paying night shift workers by the hour and started to pay them by the shift. Xerox created a new, better machine only to have it sell less well than the inferior older ones—until they figured out the salesmen got a bigger commission for selling the older one. “Well, you can say, ‘Everybody knows that,’ ” said Munger. “I think I’ve been in the top five percent of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I’ve underestimated it. And never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes my limit a little” 

> They had stumbled either upon a serious flaw in modern financial markets or into a great gambling run. Characteristically, they were not sure which it was. As Charlie pointed out, “It’s really hard to know when you’re lucky and when you’re smart.”

> Complicated financial stuff was being dreamed up for the sole purpose of lending money to people who could never repay it.

### Next: The Future Just Happened <a name="next"></a>

> And who would deny that the consumer demand for ever more stuff at ever cheaper prices is one of the great deterministic forces in history?

> The only thing capitalism cannot survive is stability. Stability—true stability—is an absence of progress, and a dearth of new wealth.

> If you’re not interested in the thing, and if you’re just in it for the money, then you’re not really going to have a sense of achievement.

### The New New Thing <a name="newnew"></a>

> For a technology company to succeed, he argued, it needed always to be looking to destroy itself. If it didn’t, someone else would.

> "No traditional Graham and Dodd investor invested in AOL,” said a banker at the table. “They shorted it. And got fucked. They’re learning the new model."

> The computer programmer creates the only path available to the computer user; the effect of his decisions on others is masked by their abstraction.

> The person who makes his living searching for the new new thing is not like most people, however. He does not seriously want to sink back into any chair. He needs to keep on groping. He chooses to live perpetually with that sweet tingling discomfort of not quite knowing what it is he wants

> The Indian engineers had the lust for the kill that Clark loved. They were ferociously, recklessly competitive.

### The Fellowship of the Ring <a name="fellowship"></a>

> “All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.”

> “Despair, or folly?' said Gandalf. 'It is not despair, for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not. It is wisdom to recognize necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our cloak, a veil before the eyes of the Enemy! For he is very wise, and weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice. But the only measure that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that having the Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of reckoning.' 
'At least for a while,' said Elrond. 'The road must be trod, but it will be very hard. And neither strenght nor wisdom will carry us far upon it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.” 

> “I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo. "So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.” 

> “Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens.” 

> “For nothing is evil in the beginning.” 

> “Indeed in nothing is the power of the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him.” 

> “Short cuts make long delays.” 

### Unbroken <a name="unbroken"></a>

> “The paradox of vengefulness is that it makes men dependent upon those who have harmed them, believing that their release from pain will come only when their tormentors suffer.” 

> “Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. The stubborn retention of it, even in the face of extreme physical hardship, can hold a man's soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it.” 

> “A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain. Louie thought: Let go.”

## Childhood <a name="childhood"></a>

Notable books that I didn't put here include all of Dan Brown's books, a few books by Tom Clancy (including Threat Vector), and the Artemis Fowl series. When I was really young, I was a big fan of the Magic Treehouse series.

* [Maniac Magee](#maniac) by Jerry Spinelli
* [Hatchet](#hatchet) by Gary Paulsen
* Summer Ball by Mike Lupica
* Travel Team by Mike Lupica

### Hatchet <a name="hatchet"></a>

> "When he sat alone in the darkness and cried and was done, all done with it, nothing had changed. His leg still hurt, it was still dark, he was still alone and the self-pity had accomplished nothing. He did not know how long it took, but later he looked back on this time of crying in the corner of the dark cave and thought of it as when he learned the most important rule of survival, which was that feeling sorry for yourself didn't work. It wasn't just that it was wrong to do, or that it was considered incorrect. It was more than that--it didn't work." 

> "Patience, he thought. So much of this was patience - waiting, and thinking and doing things right. So much of all this, so much of all living was patience and thinking."

> "That's all it took to solve problems - just sense.” 

### Maniac Magee <a name="maniacmagee"></a>

> "Nobody knows who said it first, but somebody must have: 'Kid's gotta be a maniac.'"

> "His smile was so wide he'd have had to break it into sections to fit it through a doorway"

> "Inside his house, a kid gets one name, but on the other side of the door, it's whatever the rest of the world wants to call him."
