**[vTaiwan](https://info.vtaiwan.tw/)**

The vTaiwan process consists of four successive stages - proposal, opinion, reflection and legislation - supported by a selection of colloborative open source engagement tools. 

* And an interesting leading edge of vTaiwan development is the use of 3D cameras in live-streamed stakeholder dialogues to allow observers with appropriate apps to immerse themselves in virtual reality representations of those conversations.
