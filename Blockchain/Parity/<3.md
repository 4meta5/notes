Gavin Wood was Ethereum's CTO for the first 18-24 months of the project. In this role, he was responsible for ensuring the design, development and final release of Ethereum went well. During his time as Ethereum's CTO, Gavin Wood wrote the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf), which contained the specification for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as well as the Solidity programming language. 

Since the first day of Ethereum, sharding was on the long-term roadmap.

After leaving the Ethereum Foundation, Gavin Wood was still very involved in Ethereum's development. Around mid-2016, the Parity-Ethereum client reached version 1.0 and scaling become more of a concern. Although there were many interesting ideas being discussed at a high level, Parity's team started to become impatient/frustrated with the lack of concrete specifications from the Ethereum Research team. At some point, they realized that Parity would need to build a scalable version of Ethereum with or without the Ethereum Foundation.

Before we continue, it is worth considering the difficulty faced by the Ethereum Research team at the time. Rather than having the flexibility of implementing an entirely new system from scratch, the Ethereum Foundation research team was forced to work under the constrains of the existing Ethereum implementation. As Gavin Wood mentions in the [podcast](https://www.zeroknowledge.fm/46), "uprading any system in situ is very hard; upgrading a decentralized system in situ is basically impossible."

One of the key limitation was working under the constraints of the existing system.

Upgrading any system in situ is very hard. Upgrading a decentralized system in situ is basically impossible.
