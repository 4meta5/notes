# Radical Open Mindedness

- Learning is the product of a continuous real-time feedback loop in which we make decisions, see their outcomes, and improve our understanding of reality as a result. Being radically open-minded enhances the efficiency of those feedback loops, because it makes what you are doing, and why, so clear to yourself and others that there can't be any misunderstandings. (PAGE 136)
- **Don't get hung up on your views of how things "should" be because you will miss out on learning how they really are.**<br> (PAGE 140)
- **TAKE OWNERSHIP OF CONSEQUENCES**: don't blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.

## Perspective

- **Top Down AND Bottom Up**: seeing things from the top down is the best way to understand ourselves and the laws of reality within the context of overarching universal laws...By taking a bottom-up perspective that looks at each individual case, we can see how it lines up with our theories about the laws that we expect to govern it. When they line up, we're good. (PAGE 139)
- **Distinguish between you as the designer of your machine and you as a worker with your machine.** One of the hardest things for people to do is to objectively look down on themselves within their circumstances (ie, their machine) so that they can act as the machine's designer and manager. Most people remain stuck in the perspective of being a worker within the machine. If you can recognize the differences between those roles and that it is much more important that you are a good designer/manager of your life than a good worker in it, you will be on the right path.

# Pain + Reflection = Progress

- The challenges you face will test and strengthen you. **If you're not failing, you're not pushing your limits, and if you're not pushing your limits, you're not maximizing your potential.** (PAGE 153)
- **Embrace tough love.** In my own life, what I want to give to people, most importantly to people I love, is the power to deal with reality to get what they want. In pursuit of my goal to give them strength, I will often deny them what they "want" because that will give them the opportunity to struggle so that they can develop the strength to get what they want on their own.

## Weigh 2nd and 3rd Order Consequences
> (PAGE 155)

The first-order consequences of exercise (pain and time spent) are commonly considered undesirable, while the second-order consequences (better health and more attractive appearance) are desirable. Similarly, food that tastes good is often bad for you and vice versa.

Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and sometimes they are the barriers that stand in our way. It's almost as though nature sorts us by throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizing those who make their decisionson the basis of the first-order consequences alone.

By contrast, people who choose what they really want, and avoid the temptations and get over the pains that drive them away from what they really want, are much more likely to have successful lives. 

# 5-Step Process to Get What You Want Out of Life

1. Have clear goals
2. Identify and don't tolerate the problems that stand in the way of you achieving those goals.
3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes.
4. Design plans that will get you around them.
5. Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results.

# ORGANIZE LATER / RANDOM

I believe in **due process** and **checks and balances**. These ideas may seem abstract, but consider the way by which most people make decisions or come to conclusions. Instead of concluding something one way or another, I prefer to reserve judgement and keep an open mind until I have all the facts. Even then, I consider the possibility that I am wrong. This is what I mean by *due process*. *Checks and balances* in this context refers to my preference to get a diversity of opinions before making a decision or coming to a conclusion. These opinions are weighted according to believability (which should be established based on historical *data*).
