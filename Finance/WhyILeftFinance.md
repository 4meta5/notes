# Why I Left Finance

Play on [Why I Left Goldman Sachs](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html) by Greg Smith. Many of my justifications are very similar.

## Grievances
* facade of meritocracy when in reality it is far from it
* optics are over emphasized
* requirements of respect based on hierarchy and therefore the best ideas don't always win

## Exceptions and How to Do Finance Right
* Ray Dalio (Bridgewater)
    - radical transparency and openness
    - peer reviews, etc.

## How the World is Changing
* Blockchain (the role of banks will change)
* Hedge funds may be around still, but I expect a lot of disruption in this space as well
