> some notes on things

1. How to disagree softly: when you disagree with someone, name a situation in which they are correct but that is different from the current one

2. Everything is relative -- the comparisons you make will determine your expectations and, correspondingly, your *success*.

3. Whether or not someone asks lots of questions is a good barometer for gauging intellectual curiosity.

4. People (including myself) often take lessons from rationalizing their own position in life -- be aware of this very common cognitive bias.

5. Perception is projection.

6. *Whenever a person delivers an ultimatum, always understand that this is a declaration of powerlessness. In other words, “I am so out of control in this circumstance you must do this or I will remove either myself or you from the circumstance.”* ~ RM

> it's a real shame when someone cuts you off (or anyone off) as soon as they think they get something because it can often lead to them missing a significant portion of the explanation -- I see this very often when I try to explain blockchain technology to people because they aren't willing to reason through the 3-4 steps necessary to truly understand the value proposition (I ascribe this to decreased attention spans as well as this common fallacy of asserting knowledge on unknown topics for social signalling)
