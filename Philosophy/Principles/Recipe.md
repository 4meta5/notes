Secret recipe: intellectual curiosity + drive + ambition + independent thought

# Intellectual Curiosity
On why Paulson picked Blankfein to succeed him, Blankfein was theoretically 3rd in line at the time:

“What I’d come to see in him— which I admired greatly— was he ate, slept, drank the business and the markets,” the former treasury secretary said. “He loved them. He was innately quick and very intelligent. But that can be overestimated because there are plenty of really, really bright guys that aren’t good guys or get you in trouble or don’t have good judgment. The thing that hit me about him was sort of a positive insecurity. There was no sense of entitlement. There was no arrogance to Lloyd. He was always conscious of his weaknesses and wanted to get better. So you look at certain people when they’ve been around for ﬁfteen or twenty years and get to a level of seniority, their weaknesses become exaggerated either because they become ingrained or because they’re just more exposed at a more senior level, and so people need to compensate for their weaknesses. Good leaders need the self-awareness to recognize their weaknesses and the ability to grow. And I watched Lloyd just get better and better.”

# Drive

## Discipline

From Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace (page 118) on the importance of repition when training to become good at tennis: "*Boys, what it is is I'll tell you it's repition. First last always...it's repetitive movements and motions for their own sake, over and over until the accretive weight of the reps sinks the movements themselves down under your like consciousness into the more nether regions, the C.P.S. The machine-language...Until you can do it without thnking about it, play. At like fourteen, give and take, they figure here. Just do it. Forget about is there a point, of course there's no point. The point of reptition is there is no point. **Wait until it soaks into the hardware and then see the way this frees up your head**. A whole shitload of head-space you don't need for the mechanics anymore, after they've sunk in. Now the mechanics are wired in. Hardwired in. This frees up the head in the remarkablest ways. Just wait. You start thinking a whole different way now, playing. The court might as well be inside you. The ball stops being the ball. The ball starts being something that you just know ought to be in the air, spinning.*" This quote applies to more than just tennis.
