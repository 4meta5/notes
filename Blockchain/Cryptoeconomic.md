* Interactive Coin Offerings
* selfish mining papers
* coalition game theory

> decent mapping of economic constructs to the parts of the blockchain, but don't constrain yourself to this mode of thought

"Is Google AdWords cryptoeconomic? Well, it certainly is not because it existed before Bitcoinm but in a way it is a fairly complex and sophisticated, automated, money driven auction system."

"**Cryptoeconomics is an area combining together ideas from cryptography, game theory, fault tolerance and decentralization in order to build systems that have security properties that any one of those things alone can't provide.** The one example I always give is basically just **the Nakomoto blockchain** itself, because it is almost a philosophical innovation. **You have a system which defines an asset inside of itself and that asset is responsible for incentivizing the systems continued existence.** That's something that's very powerful and interesting by itself, and then on top of it, lots of things can get built." - **Vitalik Buterin**
