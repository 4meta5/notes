"When you architect for complex systems, you design for early failure because only through early failure do you find out what is possible" ~ Dave Snowden

If you overly constrain a system that can't be naturally constrained, people will work around the constraints.

You understand a complex system by interacting with it, not by modeling or analysis. 

The only certainty is that any intervention will have unintended consequence.

There's nothing like a crisis to produce innovation; in fact, innovation is all about starvation, pressure, and perspective shift (when we can't use existing things and need to come up with something new).

> Hawthorne Effect (so we need to test in parallel instead of sequential; sequential testing can be misleading because we'll cease testing prematurely)

Unarticulated needs (surface the things that people don't yet know what they want)

> You can write down 10% of what you know. Anything dealing in text is a very limited amount of the overall knowledge.

Architecting for discovery instead of architecting for delivery.

> never scale a complex system by aggregation or imitation; you decompose things to the lowest object, define protocols for interactions between the objects, and allow novel interactions between the objects...

Challenge for design and architecture is to move earlier in the cycle to find inarticulated needs.
