## (college)

In the Spring of 2018, I wrote a [survey paper on Fully Homomorphic Encryption](./ModernFHE.pdf) for UVA CS 4501 Introduction to Cryptography, taught by Professor Mohammed Mahmoody. I have also compiled a [list](./Bitcoin.md) of the academic ideas from Cryptography that underpin Bitcoin based on [Bitcoin's Academic Pedigree](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3136559) by Arvind Narayanan and Jeremy Clark.
