# Futarchy
> Robin Hanson (2007) -- read primary texts

Hansen claims that democracies "fail largely by not aggregating available information" and that "betting markets are our best known institution for aggregating information". 

Vitalik came up with DAOs: "DAOs allow us to very quickly prototype and experiment with an aspect of our social interactions that is so far arguably falling behind our rapid advancements in information and social technology elsewhere: organizational governance" (Buterin 2014)

"Futarchy is definitely an interesting idea, but it's main challenge is a measurement problem. So basically, for futarchy you have to have an objective, and then how do you measure from inside the system whether or not the objective has been satisfied?"
