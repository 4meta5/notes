## Inflation <a name="inflation"></a>
* Inflation may no longer be the first or best indicator of a tight labor market and rising pressures on resource utilization. Part of the reason inflation sends a weaker signal is undoubtedly the achievement of anchored inflation expectations and the related flattening of the Phillips curve.14 Whatever the cause, in the run-up to the past two recessions, destabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial markets rather than in inflation. Thus, risk management suggests looking beyond inflation for signs of excesses. [Powell at Jackson Hole](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm)

### Inflation Expectations <a name="expectations"></a>
* Consumer confidence unexpectedly jumped in August to a cyclical high, suggesting that spending momentum may exceed current forecasts. The surge in August — the confidence index reached the highest level since late 2000 — came in well above consensus projections and stands in contrast to the decline in the University of Michigan survey. [August 29, Bloomberg](https://newsletters.briefs.bloomberg.com/document/MklrS9P3Q1u3mQi2iNAqIw--_2lz2ueyi4g6z35jops/in-focus)

### Hurricane Florence <a name="florence"></a>
* transitory; may need to focus on core measures instead of headline

### Oil prices <a name="energy"></a>
* Oil prices have climbed rapidly over the past year, reflecting both supply and demand factors. Although higher oil prices are likely to restrain household consumption in the United States, much of the negative effect on GDP from lower consumer spending is likely to be offset by increased production and investment in the growing U.S. oil sector. Consequently, higher oil prices now imply much less of a net overall drag on the economy than they did in the past, although they will continue to have important distributional effects. The negative effect of upward moves in oil prices should get smaller still as U.S. oil production grows and net oil imports decline further.

## Labor Market <a name="labor"></a>
```
Metrics = {
		demographic: {LFPR, EPOP};
		lowUnemployment: {U3, U6};
		noLaborSlack: {total nonfarm payroll employment (nfp), private sector openings, quit rate, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits, hiring rate};
		laborCostPressures: {average hourly earnings, employment cost index}; //productivity
}
```
* lack of skilled labor; greater labor-cost pressures should catalyze productivity growth
* "increasing labor scarcity is finally driving up labor costs. In turn, this will increase confidence that 2% inflation can indeed be sustained."-- Bloomberg Econ Brief 9/10

### Wage Pressure <a name="wage"></a>
* Payroll gains have averaged more than 200,000 per month, a step-up from the 2017 pace and well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force

### Phillips Curve <a name="phillips"></a>
* Wage pressure; labor cost pressure -> increased productivity
* longer-run unemployment rate based on June SEP at 4.5%, but probably lower
* At 3.9 percent, the August unemployment rate was about 1/2 percentage point lower than the previous year. If unemployment continues to decline at the same rate as we have seen over the past year, we will soon see unemployment rates not seen since the 1960s. Historically, the few periods when resource utilization has been at similarly tight levels have tended to see elevated risks of either accelerating inflation or financial imbalances.

### Demographic <a name="demographic"></a>
* Among prime-age workers, the employment-to-population ratio is 79.3 percent, up almost 1 percentage point over the past year. These developments are heartening, suggesting the tight labor market is providing employment opportunities to more Americans.
*  Labor force participation rates (LFPRs) for men and women between 25 and 54 years old--that is, the share of these individuals either working or actively seeking work--trended lower between 2000 and 2013. Those trends likely reflect numerous factors, including a long-run decline in the demand for workers with lower levels of education and an increase in the share of the population with some form of disability. By contrast, the prime-age LFPR has increased notably since 2013, and the share of nonparticipants who report wanting a job remains above pre-recession levels. Thus, some continuation of the recent increase in the prime-age LFPR may be possible if labor demand remains strong.

* "Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending--including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households' net worth"
* Components of GDP
* Q2 GDP: 4.2%. Look for investment to play an increasingly important role in economic growth as aggregate demand for goods and services remains strong and resource utilization tightens. [August 30, Bloomberg](https://newsletters.briefs.bloomberg.com/document/MklrS9P3Q1u3mQi2iNAqIw--_44z2uomgm88zps2hrn/in-focus)

## Fiscal Stimulus <a name="fiscal"></a>
* Moreover, the sizable fiscal stimulus that is in train is likely to provide a tailwind to growth in the second half of the year and beyond.2 From a position of full employment, the economy will likely receive a substantial boost from $1.5 trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts and a $300 billion increase in federal spending, with estimates suggesting a boost to the growth rate of real GDP of about 3/4 percent this year and next.3 [Brainard] -- May 31, 2018
* What are the risks here? 

### Housing <a name="housing"></a>
* weak new housing statistics in June (probably not improving)

### Trade Relations <a name="trade"></a>
* Net exports were a major story line in 2Q. The second print confirmed that trade activity picked up in anticipation of worsening tensions over tariffs. Exports were little changed from the first release, and remained a source of growth. Yet imports slowed in the latest revision, which, in turn, boosted the contributions to growth from the external sector. [August 30, Bloomberg](https://newsletters.briefs.bloomberg.com/document/MklrS9P3Q1u3mQi2iNAqIw--_44z2uomgm88zps2hrn/in-focus)
* The battle kept up this week, with the U.S. government imposing a 10% tariff on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods exported to the U.S. effective Sept. 24. The tariff rate will be lifted to 25% early next year. China announced that it will retaliate by imposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports.[September 20, Bloomberg](https://newsletters.briefs.bloomberg.com/document/MklrS9P3Q1u3mQi2iNAqIw--_44z2vo636kgzxu0hm0/must-reads)

### USD <a name="usd"></a>
* inextricably linked to [trade](#trade) (define the relation)

## Financial Markets <a name="finance"></a>
* Corporate credit spreads are very narrow and equity valuations are elevated relative to historical patterns

### Leveraged Loans <a name="levfin"></a>
* Rising risks are notable in the corporate sector, where low spreads and loosening credit terms are mirrored by rising indebtedness among corporations that could be vulnerable to downgrades in the event of unexpected adverse developments. Leveraged lending is again on the rise; spreads on leveraged loans and the securitized products backed by those loans are low, and the Board's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices suggests that underwriting standards for leveraged loans may be declining to levels not seen since 2005. [Brainard](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180912a.htm) -- September 12, 2018

### Flattening Yield Curve <a name="yield"></a>
* One reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changed correlation between stock and bond returns, likely associated with changes in expected inflation outcomes.18 The other driver of the low level of the term premium globally is the asset purchases of central banks in several major economies.19 In this case, if the term premium rises as the effect of asset purchase programs diminishes, the effect may be to forestall an inversion of the long-dated yield curve. [Brainard](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180912a.htm) -- September 12, 2018
* "...inferring economic causality from statistical correlations was not appropriate. A number of global factors were seen as contributing to downward pressure on term premiums, including central bank asset purchase programs and the strong worldwide demand for safe assets." [August minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180801.pdf)

## Policy <a name="policy"></a>
* "This toolkit included threshold-based forward-guidance policies, in which the Committee communicates that the federal funds rate will remain at the ELB until either inflation or the unemployment rate reaches a certain threshold" [August minutes intro](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180801.pdf)
* "balance sheet policies, involving increases in the size or duration of the Federal Reserve's asset holdings."
* "A couple of participants saw macroprudential and regulatory policies as tools that could be used to mitigate the risk of financial imbalances inducing an economic downturn in which the ELB constrained the federal funds rate."
* Brainard Speech on High Short-Term Fed Funds Neutral rate [Brainard](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180912a.htm) -- September 12, 2018
    * In the latest FOMC SEP median path, by the end of next year, the federal funds rate is projected to rise to a level that exceeds the longer-run federal funds rate during a time when real GDP growth is projected to exceed its longer-run pace and unemployment continues to fall. The shift from headwinds to tailwinds may be expected to push the shorter-run neutral rate above its longer-run trend in the next year or two, just as it fell below the longer-run equilibrium rate following the financial crisis. Notably, the sizable fiscal stimulus in the pipeline is likely to continue to bolster the short-run neutral rate over the next two years. The relatively rich level of current asset valuations relative to historical levels is another factor that could push the short-run neutral rate above its longer-run value. As was noted in the recent FOMC minutes, corporate credit spreads are very narrow, and equity valuations are elevated relative to historical patterns, even after taking into account the low level of interest rates.12 Business and consumer confidence is high, which is also consistent with a higher shorter-run neutral rate of interest.

### Interest Rate Policy <a name="fedfunds"></a>
* Over the first half of 2018, the FOMC has continued to gradually increase the target range for the federal funds rate. Specifically, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at its meetings in March and June, bringing it to the current range of 1 3/4 to 2 percent. The decisions to increase the target range for the federal funds rate reflected the economy's continued progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Even with these policy rate increases, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
* The FOMC expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Consistent with this outlook, in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which was compiled at the time of the June FOMC meeting, the median of participants' assessments for the appropriate level for the federal funds rate rises gradually over the period from 2018 to 2020 and stands somewhat above the median projection for its longer-run level by the end of 2019 and through 2020. (The June SEP is presented in Part 3 of this report.) However, as the Committee has continued to emphasize, the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate will depend on the Committee's assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum-employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
* Balance sheet policy. The FOMC has continued to implement the balance sheet normalization program described in the Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that the Committee issued about a year ago. Specifically, the FOMC has been reducing its holdings of Treasury and agency securities by decreasing, in a gradual and predictable manner, the reinvestment of principal payments it receives from these securities. [recent mpr](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2018-07-mpr-summary.htm)
### Balance Sheet Policy <a name="balance"></a>
* The payment of interest on reserves--balances held by banks in their accounts at the Federal Reserve--is an essential tool for implementing monetary policy because it helps anchor the federal funds rate within the FOMC's target range. This tool has permitted the FOMC to achieve a gradual increase in the federal funds rate in combination with a gradual reduction in the Fed's securities holdings and in the supply of reserve balances. The FOMC judged that removing monetary policy accommodation through first raising the federal funds rate and then beginning to shrink the balance sheet would best contribute to achieving and maintaining maximum employment and price stability without causing dislocations in financial markets or institutions that could put the economic expansion at risk.
