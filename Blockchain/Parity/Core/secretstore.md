# Parity Secret Store

The Parity Secret Store is core technology that enables
* distributed elliptic curve (EC) key pair generation - key is generated by several parties using special cryptographic protocol, so that
    * private key portion remains unknown to every single party
    * public key portion could be computed on every party and could be safely exposed to external entities
    * every party hold the 'share' of the private key
    * any subset of `t+1` parties could unite to restore the private portion of the key
    * any subset of less than `t+1` parties could not restore the private portion of the key
* distributed key storage - private key shares are stored separately by every party and are never exposed neither to another parties, nor to external entities.
* threshold retrieval according to blockchain permissions - all operations that are requiring private key require at least `t+1` parties to agree on 'Permissioning contract' state
