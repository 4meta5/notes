## Spending Time Effectively

Everything is relative, including happiness and enjoyment of any one activity. With this in mind, during times of respite, we often spend our idle time watching shows or movies that are not useful for our life aspirations. Interestingly, we'll often notice that we have a thorough understanding and trivia-esque knowledge of the information we consume during this time. 

Indeed, our brains are constantly absorbing information. Whether you smart is all about aligning your incentives so that even when you need a break, you take an interest in intellectually stimulating material. Consider how the recommendation algorithms are often **leading** you down a path of laziness and lack of thought. RESIST AND FIGHT BACK!

Find joy in studying and working on stuff that will help you change the world. Beauty is all about perspective and, if you can gain an appreciation of the things that other people consider `boring` or `annoying`, you will more easily develop valuable skills. It is a fact that we learn things faster if we're interested in them -- **mindset and perspective** are integral to learning new things efficiently and effectively. 

Above all else, don't put yourself in a box or place limitations on yourself based on past experience. Expertise developed in the past is valuable, but don't let it dictate what you can and cannot do in the future. Admit when you don't have an experience in an area, but don't eliminate the opportunity to learn it.

### Trap
The motivation trap occurs when you start becoming dependent on motivation to jumpstart your productivity. With this in mind, motivational videos should be used sparingly in time of necessity. If they are invoked more than once a day or even more than once a week, they will lose their potency.

Part of the trap entails watching motivational videos, and feeling as if one is fulfilled from the video itself instead of putting their transitory drive into action.
