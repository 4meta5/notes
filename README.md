# Principles
> "Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can't stop our movement down this river and we can't avoid those encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way." - [Principles](https://www.principles.com/) by Ray Dalio

Inspired by Ray Dalio's book [Principles](https://www.principles.com/), I have started to organize my own life principles/values, most important of which include:
1. Radical Open Mindedness
2. Thoughtful Disagreement
3. Pain + Reflection = Progress

# Blockchain
> "When we remove the gatekeepers that babysit every state transition [within an application], we can create very novel mechanisms to effectively harness collective intelligence." ~ Gavin Wood, Parity Technology London Meet-Up

# Economics

# RadicalXChange
> "In the present stage of technological and economic development, when cooperation has grown too large to be managed by moral economies, the market is the appropriate computer to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. If we see it as such, we can fix the bugs in the market's code and enable it to generate more wealth that is distributed more fairly." - [Radical Markets]() by Posner, Weyl

I am committed to realizing the Radical Markets vision via the RadicalXChange movement (led by E. Glen Weyl). In this folder, I have organized my [notes](./RadicalXChange/RadicalMarkets.md) on the book, [ideas](./RadicalXChange/Ideas.md) motivated by the book, and thoughts on related topics (like QV, Liberal Radicalism, etc).
