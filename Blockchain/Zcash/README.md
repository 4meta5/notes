*Currently, the most efficient known way to produce zero knowledge proofs that are non-interactive and short enough to publish to a blockchain is to have an initial setup phase that generates a common reference string shared between prover and verifier. We refer to this common reference string as the public parameters of the system.*

## Blind Spots
* parameter generation (very cool multiparty protocol)
