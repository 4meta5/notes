# Trouble With Macroeconomics
> [Romer's Paper](https://paulromer.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WP-Trouble.pdf)

*As former Fed chariman Alan Greenspan put it, "The models failed at a time when we needed them most...JP Morgan had the American economy accelerating three days before [the Lehman Borthers' collapse]--their model failed. The Fed model failed. The IMF model failed...So that left me asking myself: What happened?" Bill Dudley, president of the New York Fed, honed in on the problem when he said, "I think there's a fundamental problem in terms of how macroeconomists look at the economic outlook, growth, and inflation...If you look at the big macro models, they don't have a financial sector typically in them. They don't admit the possibility that the financial sector could essentially melt down, and therefore the monetary policy impulse could be completely impaired. So I think the lesson of the crisis is to do a lot more work to make sure that the finance people are talking to the macroeconomist people and building models that are more robust.* - Page 83, Principles by Ray Dalio
