## Government Corruption

History as recent as the Nisman affair demonstrates an overwhelming lack of transparency and public accountability. Biased media and coverups make it almost impossible for people to sift fact from fiction.

"Because it is generally assumed that Buenos Aires will continue to grow in a haphazard manner, despite planning efforts, the inflexibility of the proposed expansion of the centralized system in Buenos Aires makes it particularly unsuited to this location. Several of our interviewees in fact argued that the city’s haphazard “organic” growth is the very reason why the centralized “monster project” will never succeed in providing services for all, even if implemented. Interviews with nongovernmental organizations and community organization representatives suggest that organizations in some of the underserved areas are seeking solutions and gathering arguments to convince authorities to implement decentralized solutions. This demographic crisis, which has not only prevailed but worsened in spite of the various reforms, might induce a refocusing in the problem perception because it challenges the present centralized “larger-and-longer-pipes” solution. Decentralized systems are undeniably more flexible than central ones; however, they do not automatically challenge the linear end-of-pipe paradigm (they may simply rely on smaller and shorter pipes)." **[The notion of sewage as waste: a study of infrastructure change and institutional inertia in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Vancouver, Canada](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol19/iss2/art19/)**, 2014

"In Buenos Aires, on the other hand, the low cost innovations initially adopted at the community level, including small bore sewers and piping brackish water to homes, were soon supplanted by more centrally-managed water and sanitation networks. The principal challenge has been to get these more centralized systems extended to low income settlements. Similarly, while efforts to develop the capacity to handle finance within the community was central in the other cities, in Buenos Aires the key issues have centred more on government finance and conventional service tariffs." **[Improving water and sanitation provision in Buenos Aires](https://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/10583IIED.pdf)**, June 2010
