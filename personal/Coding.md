* some quotes/articles on how being able to code is like having a voice in our new digital society

## Discipline
Requires discipline. Many good programmers learn through school, but I'll explain why that's not the smartest approach.

> From Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace on the importance of repition when training to become good at tennis: "*Boys, what it is is I'll tell you it's repition. First last always...it's reptitive movements and motions for their own sake, over and over until the accretive weight of the reps sinks the movements themselves down under your like consciousness into the more nether regions, the C.P.S. The machine-language...Until you can do it without thnking about it, play. At like fourteen, give and take, they figure here. Just do it. Forget about is there a point, of course there's no point The point of reptition is there is no point. **Wait until it soaks into the hardware and then see the way this frees up your head**. A whole shitload of head-space you don't need for the mechanics anymore, after they've sunk in. Now the mechanics are wired in. Hardwired in. This frees up the head in the remarkablest ways. Just wait. You start thinking a whole different way now, playing. The court might as well be inside you. The ball stops being the ball. The ball starts being something that you just know ought to be in the air, spinning.*" This quote applies to more than just tennis.
