## Mental Transaction Costs
> Szabo `quotes` and comments in `>`

*mental accounting costs, not the physical or computational or amortized R&D costs of a payment or billing method, set the main lower bound on price granularity. Judging from price granularity trends such as the trend to- wards at rates in online services, online price granularity is far above suggested micropayment levels of a few cents or even fractions of a cent. The mental accounting costs for a typical on-line consumer seem to be somewhat higher than those in more familiar areas of commerce. Customer mental transaction costs come from at least three sources: uncertain cashflows, incomplete and costly observation of product attributes, and incomplete and costly decision making.*
