## Inflation <a name="inflation"></a>
1. What is the short-term impact of trade tensions/tariffs on inflation?
    * inflation goes up

2. Inflation Transmission Mechanisms
    * high interest rates => decrease in inflation (interest rate hikes increase savings <=> less spending => decrease in inflation)

## Unemployment <a name="labor"></a>
1. What metrics are influenced by the aging post-war baby boom generation?
    - EPOP and LFPR (biased downwards)
    - boomers retiring early and exiting labor force altogether
    - older workers delaying retirement (part-time workers)

2. Unemployment Transmission Mechanisms
    * rise in interest rates lead to less investment as it costs firms more to borrow (less hiring)
    * Note that the unmeployment rate decreased during aggressive rate tightening cycle from May 2004 to May 2006 (so we shouldn't directly link fed funds rate to unemployment because there are many causal factors)

## Financial Markets <a name="finance"></a>
1. Financial Stability Transmission Mechanisms
    * higher bond yields => less accessible credit => lower capital investment and consumption

2. Flattening Yield Curve and Inversion?
    * One reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changed correlation between stock and bond returns, likely associated with changes in expected inflation outcomes.18 The other driver of the low level of the term premium globally is the asset purchases of central banks in several major economies.19 In this case, if the term premium rises as the effect of asset purchase programs diminishes, the effect may be to forestall an inversion of the long-dated yield curve.

    * "...inferring economic causality from statistical correlations was not appropriate. A number of global factors were seen as contributing to downward pressure on term premiums, including central bank asset purchase programs and the strong worldwide demand for safe assets."

## GDP <a name="gdp"></a>
1. What is the longer-term impact of trade tensions/tariffs on inflation?
    * decreases NX => decreases GDP => disinflationary
2. How do increasing oil prices effect GDP?
    * Oil prices have climbed rapidly over the past year, reflecting both supply and demand factors. Although higher oil prices are likely to restrain household consumption in the United States, much of the negative effect on GDP from lower consumer spending is likely to be offset by increased production and investment in the growing U.S. oil sector. Consequently, higher oil prices now imply much less of a net overall drag on the economy than they did in the past, although they will continue to have important distributional effects. The negative effect of upward moves in oil prices should get smaller still as U.S. oil production grows and net oil imports decline further.

## Policy <a name="policy"></a>
1. Transmission Mechanisms for Balance Sheet Normalization
    - reduction in long-term UST and agency MBS => Increased Supply of long-term USTs and agency MBS => higher long-term interest rates and a longer term premium

## History <a name="history"></a>
