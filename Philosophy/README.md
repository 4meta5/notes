## Principles
> "Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can't stop our movement down this river and we can't avoid those encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way." - [Principles](https://www.principles.com/) by Ray Dalio

I have organized lists of [Articles](./Principles/Articles.md), [Books](./Principles/Books.md), and [Papers](./Principles/Papers.md) that have had a significant impact on how I perceive the world and live my life. Inspired by Ray Dalio, I have also started to catalogue [my own life principles/values](./Principles/Principles.md), most important of which include:
1. Radical Open Mindedness
2. Thoughtful Disagreement
3. Pain + Reflection = Progress

> Reflecting on liberal ideals in 1960, not long after they had withstood their greatest trial, the economist Friedrich Hayek observed, “If old truths are to retain their hold on men’s minds, they must be restated in the language and concepts of successive generations” (inadvertently proving his point with the expression men’s minds). “What at one time are their most effective expressions gradually become so worn with use that they cease to carry a definite meaning. The underlying ideas may be as valid as ever, but the words, even when they refer to problems that are still with us, no longer convey the same conviction.”
