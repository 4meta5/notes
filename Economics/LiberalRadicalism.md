# Liberal Radicalism

<!--Add links later -->

Liberal Radicalism seeks to provide a more optimal answer to the question: "How do we fund public goods?" In the past, there have been two main solutions, but both fall short of the optimal solution.

**Simple private contributory systems** lead to "under-provision" of public goods that benefit many people because of the free-rider problem. Conversely, **membership systems based on 1p1v** suppress smaller organizations of great value (by not sufficiently considering the aggregate of preferences).

The **motivation** behind Liberal Radicalism is
> "to find a formula where a citizens's influence is proportional to her marginal values of the public good. This will only occur if the marginal cost of influence is proportional to the citizen's current influence, as the citizen will choose influence at the point where the marginal cost of additional influence is equal to the marginal benefit of influence (more of the public good)."

**Liberal Radicalism** claims that individuals should "make public goods contributions to projects of value to them. The amount received by the project is (proportional to) the square of the sum of the square roots of the contributions received." The essence of this scheme is that "small contributions are heavily subsidised (as these are the most likely to be distorted by free-riding incentives) while large ones are least subsidised, as these are more like public goods."

The best way to understand this public funding mechanism is to view it as a matching program, similar to when companies match an employees 401k contributions or the government matches charitable donations. This is about optimizing collective decision making.

## DETAILS

LR mechanism is "homogenous of degree one" => <br>
* Changing currencies makes no difference to the mechanism
* Groups gain nothing by splitting or combining projects with the same group of participants
* It matters little precisely how frequently the mechanism is run, whether donations are aggregated at the monthly, daily or yearly level, unless the pattern of donations is temporarily uneven in an important way.

This implies "that a community that splits in half with roughly similar contribution profiles, will receive half the aggregate funding of the total community: both halves receive one quarter. This is a clear deterrent against fragmentation and atomisation, and is the core reason why the LR mechanism can solve the public goods problem."

## The Public Goods Problem and Capitalism's Solution

Capitalism deals poorly with public goods because "each individual, if she acts selfishly, only accounts for the benefits she receives and not the benefits to all other individuals" => "funding levels will not scale with the number of individual beneficiaries as would be desirable".

## Previous Work

Grover and Ledyard (1977) and Hylland and Zeckhauser (1979) both suggested a quadratic mechanism for determining the level fo continuous public goods, but their methods require a centralized iterative process or depend heaily on an unrealistic assumption of complete information.

## Assumptions

* Section III of the paper <br>

"Assume all public goods generate independent value to citizens (no inyteractions across public goods) and that citizens have quasi-linear utility denominated in units of currency."

* realization: Capitalism assumes that an individual's wealth corresponds to the utility that they provide to society. By limiting the influence of *earned* wealth, Liberal Radicalism is a direct affront to capitalism. Even so, this is the crux of the paper's idea: to fund public goods in an *optimal* way (to benefit the public).

* Section IV <br>

"while considering incentives to affect deficits creates some complications and potential deviations from perfect optimality, the impact is small and often irrelevant. Therefore, we ommitted it from our analysis."

Is this a valid assumption? It sounds like they just didn't want to look into this.


## Kant's Categorical Imperative

A **categorical imperative** denotes an absolute, unconditioanl requirement that must be obeeyed in all circumstances and is justified as an end in itself. It is best known in its first formation: <br>
> "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law." 

A utilitarian says that murder is wrong because it does not maximize good for those involved, but this is irrelevant to people who are concerned only with maximizing the positive outcome for themselves. Therefore, Kant argues that hypothetical moral systems cannot persuade moral action or be regarded as bases for moral judgements against others, because the imperatives on which they are based for moral rely too heavily on subjective considerations. He presented a **deontological** moral system, based on the demands of the categorical imperative.
