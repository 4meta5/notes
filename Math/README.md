# Mathematics
> *Mathematics is a way of characterizing or expressing **structure**. And the universe seems to be built, at some fundamental level, out of mathematical structure. To speak metaphorically, it appears that God is a mathematician, and that the structure of the world -- God's thoughts! -- are mathematical, that this is the cloth out of which the world is woven, the wood out of which the world is built...* ~ [Meta Math](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404335.pdf) by Gregory Chaitlin

## Resources
> Contrary to popular opinion, it IS possible to teach yourself abstract mathematics without following a structured, university-led curriculum! Here are a few resources that I found useful for doing so...

High School
* [Paul's Online Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)

College
* [Jeremy Kun's Primers](https://jeremykun.com/primers/)
* [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/)

## Blind Spots
> I'm looking to improve in these areas

* Elliptic Curves
* Number Theory
* Topology
    * Metric Spaces
    * Topological Spaces
    * The Fundamental Group
    * Homology
* Analysis
    * Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality
    * Fourier Analysis
    * Probability
        * Probabilistic Bounds
        * Martingales and the Optional Stopping Theorem
        * Markov Chain Monte Carlo
* Perfectoid Spaces (for bridging algebraic and analytic geometry)
    * lmao jk, I'll need to spend a few years learning more math first
