# Poor Self-Organization

This is sort of just a list of my grievances with the rest of humanity. Despite huge leaps in technological progress, we cling on to outdated communication and governance mechanisms. The current paradigm for communicating information to the masses lacks oversight and has been proven to be easily manipulatable. At the end of the day, this comes down to the fact that channels through which people get their news are controlled by a few powerful entities. The argument that "nothing is objective" belies the fact that the current structure enables entities to confuse and mislead the general public. My hope is that over the course of my lifetime, I can work to alleviate some of these grievances by contributing to the blockchain movement to build secure, scalable, and decentralized networks for communication. 

I may consider splitting each of them into their own doc depending on how they grow, but I'm brainstorming here for now.

## Effective Governance

## Diversity
**Why Diversity is as important to Blockchains as Decentralization**
* An ideal to aspire towards like decentralization.
* why do we aspire for decentralization? ideal is that this implies trustless computation
* this view follows the implicit philosophy of [futarchy](), which says that a *diversity* of opinions gives the best outcome
