> some notes on things

1. How to disagree softly: when you disagree with someone, name a situation in which they are correct but that is different from the current one

2. Everything is relative -- the comparisons you make will determine your expectations and, correspondingly, your *success*.

3. Whether or not someone asks lots of questions is a good barometer for gauging intellectual curiosity.

4. People (including myself) often take lessons from rationalizing their own position in life -- be aware of this very common cognitive bias.

5. Perception is projection.
