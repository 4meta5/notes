>  To provide a clear example of the utility of Obliv-C for analyzing sensitive datasets, additional data for computation was obtained from the public New York State Department of Health dataset of Hospital Inpatient Discharges from 2011 [6] and is currently being tested. This dataset is publicly available and in a single database, but provides a reasonable model of data that is sensitive and would be kept privately in different subsets kept by different organizations. The datasets used in our preliminary experiments assume that data is matched, sorted, and comprises of comparable values. In a realistic scenario, it is more likely that the two parties have data for different individuals, and first need to match up the corresponding records. This can be done using private set intersection, which has been efficiently implemented as an MPC [5].
