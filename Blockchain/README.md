* data availability and validity
    * erasure encoding
* rent
    * [ethnews high level article on rent](https://www.ethnews.com/to-alleviate-ethereum-state-bloat-developers-consider-charging-rent)
* sources of randomness
    * mpc
    * collective coin flipping; randao; dfinity threshold scheme
* fork choice rules (in ./Basics)
* DAGS
    * GHOST to SPECTRE: single-winner abstract voting rule --> multi-winner abstract voting rule, yielding more robust consensus properties.
    * SPECTRE to PHANTOM: pairwise ordering --> linear ordering, achieved by additional assumption on network delay *upper bound*
    * SpaceMesh

**presumably lamer stuff that could be cool to read about, but less important than the above**<br>
* mesh networks
* token bonding curves (and ODE tbh) (Trent Mconaughy, SimonDLR, and others...NEED TO CREATE MY GRAPH)
* decentralized storage (look at ZeroKnowledgeFM podcasts)
* outsourcing computation to off-chain (Truebit)
* decentralized loan pool protocols -- I have an interest
* mining pool protocols (loi luu's protocol)
