# Erasure Encoding

While the *Hamming code* meets the Hamming bound, which is a measure of how densely a code can be packed inside an ambient space and still maintain a given distance, the **Reed-Solomon code** optimizes for a different bound called the *Singleton bound*. We will eventually generalize this to a larger class of codes called Reed-Muller codes.
