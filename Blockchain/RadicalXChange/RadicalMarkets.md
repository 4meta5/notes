## Property is Monopoly
> *The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the word is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist* - John Maynard Kaynes, 1936

**Harberger Tax**: *If taxes are to be levied...on...the value of...properties...it is important that assessment procedures be adopted which estimate the true economic value...The economist's answer...is simple and essentially full-proof: allow each...owner...to declare the value of his own property, make the declared values...public, and require that an owner sell his property to any bidder...willing to pay...the declared value. This system is simple, self-enforcing, allows no scope for corruption, has negligible cost of administration, and creates incentives, in addition to those already present in the market, for each property to be put to that use in which it has the highest economic productivity.* - Arnold Harberger, 1962

* it penalizes any attempt to exercise monopoly power over an asset
* Full allocative efficiency is achieved: every asset passes to the hands of the person best able to use it and invest in it.

George's proposal failed because of the concern that people would not invest in their property if they must pay confiscatory taxes on the rents it produces (trades allocative efficiency for decreased investment efficiency).

When the tax is reduced incrementally to improve investment efficiency, the loss in allocative efficiency is less than the gain in investment efficiency. The reason is that the most valuable sales are ones where the buyer is willing to pay significantly more than the seller is willing to accept...In fact, it can be shown that the size of the social loss from monopoly power grows quadratically to the extent of this power. Thus, reducing the markup by a third eliminates close to 5/9 of the allocative harm from private ownership. Furthermore, in this example the distortion to investment is eliminated.

It is always optimal to have at least a very small tax. For example, a 1% tax will hardly distort investment at all but can still significantly improve allocative incentives. The owner will self-assess with reasonable accuracy to minimize her tax bill, but she will not be deterred from making valuable investments in the property. It is typically optimal to **set a moderate tax rate, below turnover rate**, that balances these two forces.

We call this the **Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax (COST**. (PAGE 61)

In the current system of private property, buying assets outright is very expensive and thus often requires large reserves of cash or the capacity to borrow. A COST would mitigate this problem because possessors anticipate the taxes that they will pay in the future, the price they will set on an asset will fall dramatically, as it would be discounted by the amount of future COST payments. (PAGE 68)

Because most of the returns to capital flow to the very wealthy, a broad distinction exists between those who live primarily off the returns to capital and those who live off their labor. A COST would make most of the return to capital flow to the public, making it more equally distributed than wages. The COST would thus end the conflict between capital and labor, making differences in labor income the leading source of inequality. (PAGE 75)

## Radical Democracy
> *First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out -- Because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out -- Because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out -- Because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak for me* - German Protestant theologian Martin NiemÃ¶ller

The idea behind an auction, Vickrey realized, *is not* allocating the good to the highest bidder. Instead it is that *each individual must pay an amount equal to the cost that her actions impose on others*. (PAGE 99)

If we care about the overall or aggregate well-being of everyone in the town, then we need a way of determining whether the intense preferences of the minority outweigh the weak preferences of the majority. (PAGE 101)

What's important is not so much the total cost of each number of votes, but that the marginal cost of casting the next vote grows proportionally to the number of votes cast. (PAGE 107)

[Quadratic Voting](./QuadraticVoting.md)(QV)

Rating and social aggregation systems fuel today's digital economy. Reputation systems are the crucial trust mechanisms that allow "sharing economy" services like Airbnb, VRBO, Uber, and Lyft to win consumer acceptance and give providers the confidence to adopt the system...Yet a growing body of evidence suggests these systems are badly broken...almost all reviews cluster towards five stars, and a few at one star, making the resulting feedback biased and noisy. 
> With QV, users could have voice credits that they receive for participation (say a certain number for every stay, ride, or post) that they then could use to evaluate the performance of others on the system. The cost of votes pro and con would grow quadratically and participants could save their credits for future interactions or use saved credits for those about which they feel more strongly at present. Such a system combines the best of both tipping and rating, creating a real cost to expressing enthusiasm, but also discouraging free-riding and allowing other participants to benefit from the feedback. (PAGE 117)

The broader the scope of use of voice credits, the better. (PAGE 123)

**QV** empowers citizens to express their views in a fundamentally richer and deeper way than 1p1v allows. It encourages citizens and politicians not just try to win over poorly informed swing voters or to motivate disaffected members of their own base, but to engage with people who have different views. It would allow citizens to focus their voting on topics of their true passion and knowledge, rather than force them to vote on issues on which they feel ill-informed and thus liable to conform to stereotypes and party identification. Because QV penalizes extreme views by making them costlier to express, it encourages moderation and compromise. By offering broader freedom, subject to a budget constraint, it gives citizens greater responsibility and control over collective decisions. In the same way that participating in public protests often gives citizens a sense of ownership over policy choices, QV would offer citizens the chance to feel their vote had been more fully heard, both helping them win on the issue most important to them and reconciling them to the losses they suffer. (PAGE 124)

## Uniting the World's Workers

In modern developed economies, a family of average income enjoys a standard of living similar to that of the very weakthiest families in poor counties. Theirs was a world in which migration did most people little good; ours is one in which migration can be a primary route to well-being and prosperity for most people in the world. (PAGE 135)

In their famous 1941 treatise, "Protection and Real Wages," Wolfgang Stolpher and Paul Samuelson claimed that while trade between a pair of countries always increases the aggregate wealth of both countries, it can have important redistributive effects. Specifically, trade tends to benefit the factors of production that a nation has in relative abundance and to hurt those it has in relatively scarce supply. Wealthy countries, by definition, have greater relative abundance of capital as compared to labor than do poor countries. It is thus natural that trade and migration should both benefit capitalists in wealthy countries and laborers in poor countries at the expense of laborers in wealthy countries and capitalists in poor countries. (PAGE 143)

Many Europeans are not just abstractly aware of the possibility that migrants strain social services, but also see with their own eyes migrants competing for access to these services. Because of the historical homogeneity of many continental European countries, this competition is visually striking because migrants are easily recognizable by skin color or religious practice. (PAGE 145)

**Visa Between Individuals Program** (VIP) enables any ordinary person to sponsor a migrant worker for an indefinite period rather than a renewable three-year period. This could either bring a rotating cast of temporary guest workers (one at a time) or one permanent migrant over a lifetime. (PAGE 150) For this system to work, the law must make two further adjustments. (PAGE 153)
* First, migrant workers must be permitted to work for below the minimum wage. Under current law, a worker paid the federal minimum wage would receive almost $15,000 in one year. By way of comparison, the average annual income in Nepal is less than $1,000 and typical Nepalese make closer to $500; Haiti has similar living standards. Appplications of the federal minimum wage to migrant workers would block the enormous welfare gains that VIP would otherwise produce. 
* Second, immigration enforcement would need to be strengthened. Enforcement against future illegal immigrants would have to be more stringent to avoid undermining the rights of both the large new class of legal migrants and their hosts. However, enforcement of the VIP system would be easier than the current system because migrants desperate to enter the country can more easily find sponsors and thus avoid the risks of illegal entry.<br>

> Two critiques: (1) wouldn't the first amendment to the law put downward pressure on wages for American workers and make it difficult for them to compete with migrant workers in many cases (2) Applications to this program seem susceptible to discrimination; this idealistic scheme ignores the systemic racism perpetuated by the existing system. If the system is not fair, then illegal immigration shouldn't be enforced as aggressively...

By empowering communities to decide the texture of their cultural life, the VIP would avoid the negative reactions that are possible when people feel rapid changes are being imposed from above. (157)

> Communities are not homogeneous and this sort of program may be perceived as rapid changes imposed from above by some members of a community. Even if this is a relatively small minority, their preferences may be voiced more aggressively and this may cause strife withing the community.

We need to acknowledge that we in the United States already have a subordinate class of low-wage workers--they are illegal aliens. Americans have exploited this class for decades, and it has for those decades been tolerated by the US government because of its importance for many industries. By bringing this underground economy into the open, our approach would allow it to be regulated and monitored. It would be put on a more rational basis so that better matches are made between the needs of the US economy and the interests of foreign workers. (PAGE 165)

## Dismembering the Octopus

The basic dilemma was that while the trusts damaged market competition, enabling them to overcharge for their goods and services, they also could spread the fixed costs of production over many more consumers because of their vast scale, resulting in lower prices, and eliminate local monopolies by buying up land and local business monopolies in what economists call "vertical integration." It would thus never have made sense simply to abolish big business. (PAGE 175)

Liquid public ownership also created a paradox identified by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means in *The Modern Corporation and Private Property*. Corporations enables entrepreneurs to raise vast pools of capital to fund huge projects like railroads and steel mills by attracting millions of shareholders from around the country and world. Those owners enjoyed the rights to the corporation's profits -- either in the form of dividends or the proceeds of liquidation of the corporation after its creditors were paid off. However, they also, at least in principle, were supposed to "control" the corporation by hiring the corporation's directors, ... Yet as Berle and Means pointed out, "ownership" of a corporation is very different from ownership of ordinary property...In the case of a large corporation, millions of owners exist. If you own three shares of Google, you can vote them all you want, but your vote is unlikely to make a difference. (PAGE 177-178)

The separation of ownership and control gives rise to what economists call "agency costs"...The development of stock markets gave investors the power to obtain liquidity, but the price to be paid was loss of control -- agency costs. (PAGE 179)

When combined, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street constitute the single largest shareholder of at least 40% of all public companies in the United States and nearly 90% of public companies in the S&P 500. The fraction of US public firms held by institutional investors who simultaneously hold large blocks of other same-industry firms increased from less than 10% in 1980 to about 60% in 2010 and has continued to rise since. Institutional investors constitute the latest iteration of the Red Queen problem in antitrust enforcement. Traditional antitrust enforcement aimed to prevent any single corporation from dominating any entire market. But institutional investors have enabled investors to avoid these rules by knitting together the interests of the biggest firms that dominate any particular market -- and have done so throughout the economy. Indeed, institutional investors behave much as trusts did a century ago, but in subtler and less transparent ways. Yet the fact that these institutions have the potential to eliminate competition not just in one sector but in the whole economy, combined with the very obscurity of their actions, make their control all the more pernicious. (PAGE 184)

The logical end point of institutional investment and diversification is the coordination of all capital to extract maximum wealth from consumers and workers. (PAGE 191)

Our approach can be stated as a simple rule: No investor holding shares of more than a single effective firm in an oligopoly and participating in corporate governance may own more than 1% of the market...Because institutional investors appear to reduce competition among firms they own, they should not be permitted to own firms that are rivals within a single, concentrated industry -- with exceptions where institutional investors are small or passive. (PAGE 192)

If our proposal were put into effect, competition would instead focus on the quality of governance that institutional investors provide, leading to a market where competition between institutional investors would directly help solve the Berle-Means problems by holding institutional investors accountable for governing the companies they invest in to maximize returns. (PAGE 193-194)
