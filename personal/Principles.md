I believe in **due process** and **checks and balances**. These ideas may seem abstract, but consider the way by which most people make decisions or come to conclusions. Instead of concluding something one way or another, I prefer to reserve judgement and keep an open mind until I have all the facts. Even then, I consider the possibility that I am wrong. This is what I mean by *due process*. *Checks and balances* in this context refers to my preference to get a diversity of opinions before making a decision or coming to a conclusion. These opinions are weighted according to believability (which should be established based on historical *data*).
