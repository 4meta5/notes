Eventually, I may destructure these notes into multiple files, but for now I'm just throwing down thoughts.

* Donella Meadows
* Jay Forrester

## Themes

* human agency in computing and organization of computing
* early formation of computing systems (more boring)

* design will shape technology, culture, and use cases

* speculative futures (considering human agency in the context of increasingly complex technology)

* [Wicked Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem) by Rittel and Webber
    * As we first attempted to scale human communication, the economies of scale involved in technical development resulted in centralized control of the flow of information as well as the maintenance of significant infrastructure. This paradigm leads to implicit censorship when these centralized entities start to make decisions on what information is *good* or *bad* (s/o Google: The Good Censor). 
    * If we look at Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, etc., we see an example of a colonizing way of designing systems. These teams took agency and dominion over human participants. 
    * **We can do better, but we shouldn't build on these systems. We need to rebuild them.** This is where blockchain comes into play.

Even though design is often reduced down to a "consultancy" role, Steve Jobs showed us that design is much more than that; we can innovate and shape the world with design.
