# Algorithms
> collection of algorithm resources

A smart way to learn a programming language is to read algorithms and map practical ideas to the algorithms before writing an implementation...here's an *algorithm*
* read and understand algorithm
* find relevant use case
* implement algorithm in the context of this use case
