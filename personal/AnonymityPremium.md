# Anonymity Premium

<!-- blog post -->
The anonymity premium is defined as the implicit and explicit costs of transacting anonymously. Even if web3 succeeds in achieving its compelling vision of a permissionless and decentralized marketplace for digital interactions, establishing identity can be extremely useful (ie Liberal Radicalism). Even if workarounds are developed ([my workaround](LibRad.md)), there are still implicit costs to transacting anonymously. This often presents itself in the form of decreased opportunities to transact, especally for restricted goods/services. 

We may explore this premium. By measuring it, we may be able to create one metric for measuring the progress of the Web3 movement ([Web3Goals](Web3Goals.md)).
