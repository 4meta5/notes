# Parity <3
This document serves as an informal history of [Parity](https://parity.io) and details a few of the reasons why I think the company and its projects have a bright future.

> *In the future, trusting an institution with our interests will be as archaic a concept as reckoning on an abacus is today.* - Gavin Wood, Parity Technologies Founder

Parity's **[history](#History)** reveals the significant contributions that the company and its individuals have already made to the decentralization movement. The company has differentiated itself in its ability to identify mistakes and incorporate lessons learned into modes of operation moving forward. Moreover, they maintain great comunication with the blockchain ecosystem and exercise transparency in all major projects. Indeed, Parity serves as a model for new and existing organizations in the space.

The company owes much of its success to a **[culture](#Culture)** and philosophy of operation that supports autonomy. Parity's CTO Fredrick Harrysson has said that the company strives to embody the ideals of [Programmer's Anarchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk-CF7klLdA) to ensure that, as an employee, "you can dive as deep as you want into that rabbit hole and geek out about something you love doing". This approach to developer governance encourages creativity and innovation thereby fostering a very productive environment for solving complex problems.

From the beginning, Parity has made smart technical decisions to ensure their **[technology](#Technology)** remains relevant for the foreseeable future. By targeting WASM, coding in Rust, and using libp2p for networking, Parity has incorporated much of the best technology into its main projects. These design decisions reveal great awareness of the cutting-edge technical development both within and outside of the blockchain space. In open source software, this awareness is imperative to success as collaboration takes on newfound importance in the context of an accelerating development environment.

[Gavin Wood](http://gavwood.com/) was Ethereum's CTO for the first 18-24 months of the project. In this role, he was responsible for ensuring the design, development and final release of Ethereum went well. During his time as Ethereum's CTO, Gavin Wood wrote the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf), which contained the specification for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as well as the Solidity programming language. His contributions to the Ethereum project in its early stages were instrumental in enabling the initial launch of Ethereum. 

## Parity.init()

In 2015, Gavin and a few Ethereum developers started ETHCore, which eventually became Parity. In its early days, Parity was focused on supporting Ethereum by building core infrastructure to facilitate interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. 

Drawing on his expertise in Rust, Parity cofounder [Robert Habermeier](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadot-co-founder-robert-habermeier-named-2018-thiel-fellow-75950e2d8001) led the charge to build Parity's now longest existing project, the [Parity-Ethereum client](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum). This Ethereum blockchain client provided a much needed alternative to the most popular client, Geth. Moreover, [performance analysis](https://www.parity.io/performance-analysis/) revealed that Parity's client achieved higher processing speeds than Geth both with respect to blocks as well as the transactions within blocks. The lessons learned from Parity's experience building light clients for Ethereum shaped many of the critical design decisions made later on when building [Substrate](https://www.parity.io/substrate-in-a-nutshell/) (and [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/)).

> consider mentioning here how Robert's experience building light clients led to them essentially including light clients as a feature for Substrate blockchains

## Learning from Mistakes
> Parity's awareness of the blockchain ecosystem extends beyond recognizing and correcting for their own mistakes. Indeed, I have also been impressed by the organization's ability to identify the shortcomings of other existing projects and incorporate these observations into their own design decisions.

After nearly $100,000 USD was lost due to a security flaw in Geth/Mist in May 2016, Parity released a series of blog posts detailing the steps necessary to patch the attack vector for future clients. In the [first post](https://www.parity.io/parity-stepping-up-the-security-model-1-a-modular-approach-to-transaction-signing/), Parity cited that "the solution to the Mist hack problem will always be to isolate the process of signing transactions from Dapps, keeping the security-sensitive processes both insulated from attack and well under the control of the user. Only by doing this can you keep your keys, and the increasing shades of value they represent, safe and secure."

Two days after the infamous *Attack on the DAO* in June 2016, Parity released a [blog post](https://www.parity.io/attack-on-the-dao-what-will-be-your-response/) aimed at unifying the community. Parity provided a detailed, yet easily accessible explanation of the hack itself before encouraging a legitimate community response. In doing so, the team demonstrated the crux of decentralized governance: 
> *Decentralized consensus networks are peer-to-peer networks where individuals acting in their own self-interest maintain consensus on an agreed upon state of the blockchain database. It is these two terms; 'agreed upon' and 'self-interest' that are most important.*

Shortly thereafter, Gavin Wood published [How do we find common ground and settle our differences](https://www.parity.io/how-we-find-common-ground-and-settle-our-differences/) to explain the many incentives at play in the aftermath of the DAO hack as well as necessary next steps. He noted that "a normally immutable change had been made to the blockchain which was considered undesirable/unacceptable to a (potential) majority of the people who use the network." In trying times like these, Gavin cited the need for stakeholders to drive social consensus (and the network's decision): "It is important to note that throughout this process the developers are not expected to remain agnostic or indifferent. They are important players in the ecosystem and will likely voice their opinions on how best to evolve the network." 

Although the DAO hack precipitated Ethereum's first contentious hard fork, it also exemplified the breakthrough made by contemporary blockchain governance. When the intended execution of the protocol does not match the real world outcome, the community can take decisive action to agree on another state of the world. Some may not agree that this is the best approach, but it is my opinion that, *by providing optionality*, hard forks like the one employed after the DAO hack enable proper community governance.
> Parity published [In support of a hard fork](https://www.parity.io/in-support-of-a-hard-fork/) in mid-July 2016, expressing their support of a hard fork with a similar rationale. A week earlier, Vlad Zamfir explained in [Dear Ethereum Community](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/dear-ethereum-community-acfa99a037c4) why hard forks are a necessary part of the blockchain technology upgrade path.


## Scaling with Polkadot

Since the first day of Ethereum, sharding was on the long-term roadmap.

Around mid-2016, the Parity-Ethereum client reached version 1.0 and scaling become more of a concern. Although there were many interesting ideas being discussed at a high level, Parity's team started to become impatient/frustrated with the lack of concrete specifications from the Ethereum Research team. At some point, they realized that Parity would need to build a scalable version of Ethereum with or without the Ethereum Foundation.

Before we continue, it is worth considering the obstacles faced by the Ethereum Research team at the time. Rather than having the flexibility of implementing an entirely new system from scratch, the Ethereum Foundation research team was forced to work under the constraints of the existing Ethereum implementation. As Gavin Wood mentions in the [podcast](https://www.zeroknowledge.fm/46), "uprading any system in situ is very hard; upgrading a decentralized system in situ is basically impossible." With this in mind, Parity's team decided the best approach 

*"the next chapter hadn't been written so it was up to us to pick up the pen"*

main idea: Heterogeneous sharding

In late Summer 2016, 

Refinements in the technical specification of governance. Parachains defined in terms of WebAssembly. The main relay chain itself would also be defined in terms of WebAssembly. 

> separating human and technical governance


> transition this into culture; especially explain the mistakes of Parity


### Ethereum Hard Forks
> These were just network

> noncontroversial technical upgrades to make it better; risky and operationally heavy; people have general aversion to such things....reluctance to do anything with hard forks is resulting in a lack of innovation

> this contributed to Polkadot design choices with respect to governance

### The Parity Multisig Hack
> go through blog posts on what hey learned

> this led to more rigorous third party audit standards and a long-term partnership with Trail of Bits; audits are now the norm in the space for significant projects

In late June 2016, Gavin Wood published a post on [Condition-Oriented Programming (COP)](https://www.parity.io/condition-oriented-programming/), a hybrid approach between functional and imperative programming. Put simply, COP aims to ensure that function bodies have no conditional paths or, alternatively, never mix transitions with conditions. By discouraging conditional paths from state-transitions, this approach limits the complexity of state-transitions, thereby allowing for facilitated auditability and better testing. More than two years later, James Prestwich published [Declarative Smart Contracts](https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/declarative-smart-contracts) reiterating the necessity of a *functional* approach to smart contract code patterns. In this post, Prestwich cites that "declarative contracts align the structure of the contract implementation with the reality of the chain by defining exactly what state modifications are permissible, and letting the user modify state directly. Declarative contracts prevent unintended state changes."
