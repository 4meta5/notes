> *In the present stage of technological and economic development, when cooperation has grown too large to be managed by moral economies, the market is the appropriate computer to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. If we see it as such, we can fix the bugs in the market's code and enable it to generate more wealth that is distributed more fairly.* - [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com/) by Eric Posner, E.

These are my notes from [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com/) by Eric Posner, E. Glen Weyl; most of them are just direct quotes and I provide page numbers often.

## Property is Monopoly
> *The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the word is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist* - John Maynard Kaynes, 1936

**Harberger Tax**: *If taxes are to be levied...on...the value of...properties...it is important that assessment procedures be adopted which estimate the true economic value...The economist's answer...is simple and essentially full-proof: allow each...owner...to declare the value of his own property, make the declared values...public, and require that an owner sell his property to any bidder...willing to pay...the declared value. This system is simple, self-enforcing, allows no scope for corruption, has negligible cost of administration, and creates incentives, in addition to those already present in the market, for each property to be put to that use in which it has the highest economic productivity.* - Arnold Harberger, 1962

* it penalizes any attempt to exercise monopoly power over an asset
* Full allocative efficiency is achieved: every asset passes to the hands of the person best able to use it and invest in it.

George's proposal failed because of the concern that people would not invest in their property if they must pay confiscatory taxes on the rents it produces (trades allocative efficiency for decreased investment efficiency).

When the tax is reduced incrementally to improve investment efficiency, the loss in allocative efficiency is less than the gain in investment efficiency. The reason is that the most valuable sales are ones where the buyer is willing to pay significantly more than the seller is willing to accept...In fact, it can be shown that the size of the social loss from monopoly power grows quadratically to the extent of this power. Thus, reducing the markup by a third eliminates close to 5/9 of the allocative harm from private ownership. Furthermore, in this example the distortion to investment is eliminated.

It is always optimal to have at least a very small tax. For example, a 1% tax will hardly distort investment at all but can still significantly improve allocative incentives. The owner will self-assess with reasonable accuracy to minimize her tax bill, but she will not be deterred from making valuable investments in the property. It is typically optimal to **set a moderate tax rate, below turnover rate**, that balances these two forces.

We call this the **Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax (COST**. (PAGE 61)

In the current system of private property, buying assets outright is very expensive and thus often requires large reserves of cash or the capacity to borrow. A COST would mitigate this problem because possessors anticipate the taxes that they will pay in the future, the price they will set on an asset will fall dramatically, as it would be discounted by the amount of future COST payments. (PAGE 68)

Because most of the returns to capital flow to the very wealthy, a broad distinction exists between those who live primarily off the returns to capital and those who live off their labor. A COST would make most of the return to capital flow to the public, making it more equally distributed than wages. The COST would thus end the conflict between capital and labor, making differences in labor income the leading source of inequality. (PAGE 75)

## Radical Democracy
> *First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out -- Because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out -- Because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out -- Because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak for me* - German Protestant theologian Martin NiemÃ¶ller

The idea behind an auction, Vickrey realized, *is not* allocating the good to the highest bidder. Instead it is that *each individual must pay an amount equal to the cost that her actions impose on others*. (PAGE 99)

If we care about the overall or aggregate well-being of everyone in the town, then we need a way of determining whether the intense preferences of the minority outweigh the weak preferences of the majority. (PAGE 101)

What's important is not so much the total cost of each number of votes, but that the marginal cost of casting the next vote grows proportionally to the number of votes cast. (PAGE 107)

[Quadratic Voting](./QuadraticVoting.md)(QV)

Rating and social aggregation systems fuel today's digital economy. Reputation systems are the crucial trust mechanisms that allow "sharing economy" services like Airbnb, VRBO, Uber, and Lyft to win consumer acceptance and give providers the confidence to adopt the system...Yet a growing body of evidence suggests these systems are badly broken...almost all reviews cluster towards five stars, and a few at one star, making the resulting feedback biased and noisy. 
> With QV, users could have voice credits that they receive for participation (say a certain number for every stay, ride, or post) that they then could use to evaluate the performance of others on the system. The cost of votes pro and con would grow quadratically and participants could save their credits for future interactions or use saved credits for those about which they feel more strongly at present. Such a system combines the best of both tipping and rating, creating a real cost to expressing enthusiasm, but also discouraging free-riding and allowing other participants to benefit from the feedback. (PAGE 117)

The broader the scope of use of voice credits, the better. (PAGE 123)

**QV** empowers citizens to express their views in a fundamentally richer and deeper way than 1p1v allows. It encourages citizens and politicians not just try to win over poorly informed swing voters or to motivate disaffected members of their own base, but to engage with people who have different views. It would allow citizens to focus their voting on topics of their true passion and knowledge, rather than force them to vote on issues on which they feel ill-informed and thus liable to conform to stereotypes and party identification. Because QV penalizes extreme views by making them costlier to express, it encourages moderation and compromise. By offering broader freedom, subject to a budget constraint, it gives citizens greater responsibility and control over collective decisions. In the same way that participating in public protests often gives citizens a sense of ownership over policy choices, QV would offer citizens the chance to feel their vote had been more fully heard, both helping them win on the issue most important to them and reconciling them to the losses they suffer.

## Uniting the World's Workers

In modern developed economies, a family of average income enjoys a standard of living similar to that of the very weakthiest families in poor counties. Theirs was a world in which migration did most people little good; ours is one in which migration can be a primary route to well-being and prosperity for most people in the world. (PAGE 135)
